15                                   may it please the Court:
16                                   OSHA's economy-wide one-size-fits-all
17                                   mandate covering 84 million Americans is not a
18                                   necessary, indispensable use of OSHA's
19                                   extraordinary emergency power which this Court
20                                   has recognized is narrowly circumscribed.
21                                   Just three days ago, the. U.S. Postal
22                                   Service told OSHA that this ETS's requirements
23                                   are so burdensome for employers that the
24                                   federal government is now seeking an exemption
25                                   from its own mandate for the Postal Service.

1                                    That's because OSHA's economy-wide mandate
2                                    would cause permanent worker displacement
3                                    rippling through our national economy, which is
4                                    already experiencing labor shortages and
5                                    fragile supply lines.
6                                    OSHA has never before mandated
7                                    vaccines or widespread testing, much less
8                                    across all industries.  In fact, the June
9                                    healthcare COVID ETS and the 1991 blood-borne
10                                   pathogen rule both rejected vaccine mandates
11                                   and widespread testing, and those were even
12                                   just for targeting healthcare workers.
13                                   And, here, OSHA's vaccine-and-testing
14                                   mandate treats virtually all industries'
15                                   workplaces and workers the same.  But even
16                                   Congress's rescue plan identified high-risk
17                                   workplaces, and OSHA itself here recited state
18                                   data confirming that certain industries, like
19                                   healthcare and correction facilities, are
20                                   higher risk.
21                                   Our nation's businesses have
22                                   distributed and administered hundreds of
23                                   millions of COVID vaccines to Americans.
24                                   Businesses have encouraged and incentivized
25                                   their employees to get vaccines.  But a single

2                                    standards cannot commandeer businesses
3                                    economy-wide into becoming de facto public
4                                    health agencies.
5                                    So this Court should immediately stay
6                                    OSHA's unprecedented ETS before Monday, when
7                                    OSHA begins enforcement.
8                                    I welcome the Court's questions.
9                                    JUSTICE THOMAS:  Mr. Keller, how are
10                                   we to decide when an Emergency Temporary
11                                   Standard or Emergency Temporary Standards are
12                                   necessary?  What factors do you think we should
13                                   use?
14                                   MR. KELLER:  Justice Thomas, I think
15                                   the first factor that you would have to look at
16                                   is, is it an indispensable or essential
17                                   measure, and that necessarily would require
18                                   looking at what are the alternatives available.
19                                   You would have to also look at, necessary to
20                                   what end?  And it's to abate a grave danger.
21                                   And it's for an emergency.  It's in a temporary
22                                   setting.  So the factors you'd want to consider
23                                   are, what are the risks, and not only what are
24                                   the risks for any isolated situation but
25                                   compared to an everyday risk?

1                                    And, here, when OSHA itself has never
2                                    mandated vaccines or widespread testing before,
3                                    that itself, even in its 10 prior ETSs, which
4                                    courts blocked almost all of the challenges to
5                                    these prior ETSs, all of those are factors that
6                                    would absolutely determine the scope of what
7                                    OSHA could do here.
8                                    In fact, in the June ETS, what OSHA
9                                    said was:  "OSHA recognizes that many states
10                                   have taken action to protect employees with
11                                   mandatory requirements that may not be
12                                   appropriate for an ETS on a national level."

15                                   Maryland, Chief Justice Marshall, in looking at
16                                   necessary and proper, saw "necessary" as more
17                                   expansive than that as certainly modified by
18                                   "proper" or in the context of "proper."  So it
19                                   just suggests that "necessary" can be really
20                                   necessary or not necessarily really necessary.
21                                   MR. KELLER:  And -- and --
22                                   JUSTICE THOMAS:  The -- and -- and I
23                                   just think that, you know, the -- you need more
24                                   than to say, oh, a lot of bad things could
25                                   happen to interpret what that means.  Is it

1                                    restrictive?  Is it very firm?  Is it
2                                    super-necessary?  And if it is, why?
3                                    MR. KELLER:  Justice Thomas, the --
4                                    the reason why it would be something
5                                    approaching the indispensable or essential
6                                    definition of "necessary" here is there's a
7                                    very key intrastatutory textual clue.  The
8                                    emergency power must be necessary.  The regular
9                                    power that OSHA wields has to be reasonably
10                                   necessary or appropriate.
11                                   JUSTICE THOMAS:  So when do we
12                                   determine that?  Suppose -- you argue also this
13                                   is -- the vaccine's been around quite some
14                                   time.  COVID has been around even longer.  So
15                                   the -- the government could have had a -- a
16                                   notice and comment.  So, if it's been -- if you
17                                   have -- if it's susceptible to notice and
18                                   comment, then how do you analyze it in that
19                                   context?  You can't just say, well, it's
20                                   emergency; therefore, it has to be absolutely
21                                   necessary.  It would seem that that would
22                                   undermine your definition or your notion of
23                                   "necessary."
24                                   MR. KELLER:  Well, I think Judge
25                                   Larsen for the Sixth Circuit was absolutely

1                                    correct in saying that just because something's
2                                    temporary doesn't mean that there could somehow
3                                    be more power.  And what this Court has said is
4                                    this emergency power is narrowly circumscribed.
5                                    And regardless of wherever the line would be
6                                    drawn, I think this ETS is far past it.
7                                    And I think the federal government has
8                                    some serious line-drawing problems of its own.
9                                    I believe OSHA, under the theory that's been
10                                   advanced, could have shut down and had a
11                                   national work lockdown at the beginning of the
12                                   pandemic.  I would submit that this Court in
13                                   Industrial Union, in saying that OSHA had no
14                                   clear mandate in the Act to have that wide a
15                                   power over the American industry, is also a
16                                   factor that would go into this Court construing
17                                   what "necessary" means in light of that.
18                                   JUSTICE THOMAS:  So the fact that it
19                                   is temp -- that it's emergency sort of ups the
20                                   ante, that "necessary" has to be more
21                                   restrictive?
22                                   MR. KELLER:  Yes, because of plain
23                                   text, the comparison within the OSH Act, also
24                                   statutory context --

2                                    doctrine.
3                                    JUSTICE KAGAN:                                    -- I guess, Mr.
4                                    Keller, I -- I don't understand the point.
5                                    Whatever "necessary" means, whether it's
6                                    necessary and proper or whether it's something
7                                    more than that, why isn't this necessary to
8                                    abate a grave risk?
9                                    This is a pandemic in which nearly a
10                                   million people have died.  It is by far the
11                                   greatest public health danger that this country
12                                   has faced in the last century.  More and more
13                                   people are dying every day.  More and more
14                                   people are getting sick every day.  I don't
15                                   mean to be dramatic here.  I'm just sort of
16                                   stating facts.
17                                   And this is the policy that is most
18                                   geared to stopping all this.  There's nothing
19                                   else that will perform that function better
20                                   than incentivizing people strongly to vaccinate
21                                   themselves.
22                                   So, you know, whatever "necessary"
23                                   means, whatever "grave" means, why isn't this
24                                   necessary and grave?
25                                   MR. KELLER:  Because, Justice Kagan,

2                                    this extraordinary use of emergency power is
3                                    not what is the best way of accomplishing it.
4                                    JUSTICE KAGAN:  It's an extraordinary
5                                    use of emergency power occurring in an
6                                    extraordinary circumstance, a circumstance that
7                                    this country has never faced before.
8                                    MR. KELLER:  What OSHA needed to do
9                                    here, though -- and we do not contest that
10                                   COVID is a grave danger, but when -- a power
11                                   for it to be necessary, for instance, the Third
12                                   Circuit said in wielding what is supposed to be
13                                   a delicately exercised extraordinary power, the
14                                   agency has to consider and explain
15                                   alternatives.
16                                   The agency here complained that its
17                                   non-mandatory guidance wasn't being followed
18                                   and then instead of saying that maybe some of
19                                   those mandatory guidance -- some of those
20                                   guidances could have been made mandatory, it
21                                   jumped immediately to a vaccine-or-testing
22                                   mandate.
23                                   Moreover, OSHA typically --

1                                    situation, you know, a typical arbitrary,
2                                    capricious situation where we say, oh, you
3                                    didn't consider an alternative carefully
4                                    enough.
5                                    We all know what the best policy is.
6                                    I mean, by this point, two years later, we know
7                                    that the best way to prevent spread is for
8                                    people to get vaccinated and to prevent
9                                    dangerous illness and death is for people to
10                                   get vaccinated.  That is by far the best.
11                                   The second best is to wear masks.  So
12                                   this is a policy that basically says, we are
13                                   still confronting thousands of people dying
14                                   every time we look around, and so we're going
15                                   to put into place the policy that we know works
16                                   best, which is to strongly incentivize
17                                   vaccination and to insist that unvaccinated
18                                   people will wear masks and test.
19                                   I mean, that's just -- like, why isn't
20                                   that necessary?  What else should be done?
21                                   It's -- it's obviously the policy that's --
22                                   that's geared to preventing most sickness and
23                                   death, and the agency has done everything but
24                                   stand on its head to show quite clearly that no
25                                   other policy will prevent sickness and death to

1                                    anywhere like the degree this one will.
2                                    MR. KELLER:  Justice Kagan, first of
3                                    all, states could have policies like this.
4                                    Private businesses could have policies like
5                                    this.  And even OSHA in its June healthcare
6                                    COVID ETS -- and that was only for healthcare
7                                    workers -- did not mandate vaccines.
8                                    Instead, what it did there, similarly
9                                    to how OSHA proceeds in many contexts, is it
10                                   says, employers, give us a plan, and then, if
11                                   there are heightened needs in particular
12                                   workplaces, then additional measures can be put
13                                   into place.  But this is covering economy-wide,
14                                   all industries, 84 million Americans --
15                                   JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, that's if that
16                                   rule --
17                                   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That's one of

19                                   objections, that this is not a workplace issue,
20                                   it's -- it's an out-in-the-world issue, is that
21                                   right?
22                                   MR. KELLER:  That's right, Mr. Chief
23                                   Justice.
24                                   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but how

1                                    be before you will say that OSHA can regulate
2                                    it?
3                                    Think, for example, of an assembly
4                                    line, you know, workers sitting next to each
5                                    other for a significant length of time, working
6                                    together in close -- close contact.  That
7                                    presents a different kind of risk than is
8                                    typical in the outside world.
9                                    So could OSHA say that for businesses
10                                   with assembly lines, the workers must be
11                                   vaccinated?
12                                   MR. KELLER:  No, not vaccinated.
13                                   OSHA, though, could potentially, going by
14                                   industry by industry or workplace by workplace,
15                                   have measures such as what some of their
16                                   guidance have suggested, like, you know,
17                                   potentially barriers, but I think all of this
18                                   would be kind of --
19                                   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but
20                                   those are sort of -- as Justice Kagan has been
21                                   -- been discussing, those are sort of, you
22                                   know, not as good.  And why wouldn't OSHA have
23                                   the authority to do the best approach possible
24                                   to address what I guess you agree is a special
25                                   workplace problem?

1                                    MR. KELLER:  Well, Mr. Chief Justice,
2                                    I don't think the standard here can be the best
3                                    because, if it was the best, then that would
4                                    mean that OSHA could ban all people from coming
5                                    into the workplace.  I think that is a power
6                                    that Congress, when it created OSHA, was --
7                                    CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, so
8                                    the -- so the agency is acting, you know, less
9                                    aggressively than it might otherwise do but in
10                                   an effective way to address the problem.
11                                   MR. KELLER:  But, as soon as we get to
12                                   the point where we're talking about a less
13                                   aggressive way, there are other alternatives.
14                                   There could have been plans.  There could have
15                                   been the man -- the non-mandatory guidance that
16                                   was then put into place.  Jumping to a
17                                   vaccine-or-testing mandate when OSHA has never
18                                   exercised that power is --
19                                   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, it is a
20                                   pressing -- there is some pressing urgency to
21                                   addressing the problem and to have them sit
22                                   down and say, okay, what else could we do?  We
23                                   have to have notice -- well, notice and
24                                   comment, which I guess -- are you insisting
25                                   that that be part of the process?

6                                    because --
7                                    MR. KELLER:                    -- and we have --

9                                                                   office can't do it efficiently doesn't mean
10                                   that private industry can't.
11                                                                  MR. KELLER:  But I think what this
12                                                                  shows is workplaces are different.  And instead
13                                                                  of doing an economy-wide vaccine-or-testing
14                                                                  mandate for all purposes, OSHA needed to at
15                                                                  least consider, as it identified, there are
16                                                                  certain instances where healthcare workers and

18                                                                  a heightened risk, that's where there's a
19                                   workplace occupational --
20                                                                  JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, it is -- it's
21                                                                  -- well, okay, I -- I want to ask a provisional

23                                                                  this Court now today -- I mean, I assume your

1                                    So I'll assume for the sake of
2                                    argument that they're both fairly good
3                                    arguments, okay?
4                                    MR. KELLER:  Thank you.
5                                    JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Now
6                                    notice that's an assumption, right, but make
7                                    that assumption with me.  Are you still asking
8                                    us to issue a stay and stop this from taking
9                                    effect, like issue a stay today or tomorrow or
10                                   Sunday or Monday or Tuesday?
11                                   I mean, the reason I ask that is there
12                                   are several elements, we have some discretion
13                                   there, and -- and you know it was brought up.
14                                   I mean, there -- there were
15                                   three-quarters of a million new cases
16                                   yesterday.  New cases.  Nearly three-quarters,
17                                   700-and-some-odd thousand, okay?  That's 10
18                                   times as many as when OSHA put this rule in.
19                                   The hospitals are today, yesterday,
20                                   full, almost to the point of the maximum
21                                   they've ever been in this disease, okay?
22                                   And you heard references, studies, I
23                                   mean, they -- they vary, but some of them say
24                                   that the hospitalization is 90 percent or maybe
25                                   60 percent or maybe 80 percent, but a big

1                                    percent, filled up yesterday or the day before
2                                    with people who are not vaccinated, okay?
3                                    So that's -- we're talking about now.
4                                    And think of the stay requirements.  It's both
5                                    a balance of harms, it's also public interest.
6                                    Can you ask us -- is that what you're doing
7                                    now, to say it's in the public interest in this
8                                    situation to stop this vaccination rule with
9                                    nearly a million people -- let me not
10                                   exaggerate -- nearly three-quarters of a
11                                   million people, new cases every day?  I mean,
12                                   to me, I would find that unbelievable.
13                                   MR. KELLER:  Justice Breyer, we are
14                                   asking for a stay before enforcement takes
15                                   effect Monday.  And the reason for that is this
16                                   is an unprecedented agency action.
17                                   JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah, yeah --
18                                   MR. KELLER:  We do not --
19                                   JUSTICE BREYER:                                   -- I know you have
20                                   all good arguments that it isn't good.  They
21                                   have arguments that it is good.
22                                   Okay.  I'm asking you a different
23                                   question, and the question is:  How can it
24                                   conceivably be in the public interest with
25                                   three-quarters of a million people yesterday,

1                                    goodness knows how many today -- I don't want
2                                    to repeat myself, but you have the
3                                    hospitalization figures growing by factors of
4                                    -- of 10, 10 times what it was.
5                                    You have hospitalization at the
6                                    record, near the record.  You have -- you have
7                                    -- I mean, you understand the thing -- things
8                                    as well as I.  And so I repeat my question, to
9                                    me, it's unbelievable, but I want to hear what
10                                   you say.
11                                   How can it be in the public interest,
12                                   which is a requirement, how can it be a balance
13                                   of harms in this case, assuming the arguments
14                                   aren't off the wall on the government's side,
15                                   and believe me, they're not.  Okay, that's what
16                                   I want to hear the answer to.
17                                   MR. KELLER:  Justice Breyer, states
18                                   can act, private businesses have acted on
19                                   historic levels.  This is going to cause a
20                                   massive economic shift in the country, billions
21                                   upon billions of non-recoverable costs.
22                                   Testing also is not frequently available.  This

1                                    find adequate providers to ensure that weekly

3                                    If Congress intended to give an
4                                    occupational health agency the power to mandate
5                                    vaccines across the country, it needed to do so
6                                    clearly.  States can do it.  Businesses have
7                                    done it and are able to do it.
8                                    The question is not what is this
9                                    country going to do about COVID.  It's who gets
10                                   to decide that.
11                                   JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, who does get --
12                                   JUSTICE ALITO:  And, Mr. Keller --
13                                   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Maybe, at this
14                                   point, we can go justice by justice.
15                                   Justice Thomas, anything further?
16                                   JUSTICE THOMAS:  Not for me.
17                                   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice
18                                   Gorsuch?
19                                   JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Oh.  I do have a
20                                   couple of questions, Mr. Keller.
21                                   First, the government says that the
22                                   major questions doctrine and the federalism
23                                   canon, for example, don't apply to this Court's
24                                   consideration of this case or any other unless
25                                   the statute before us is first found to be

1                                    ambiguous.
2                                    What's your understanding?
3                                    MR. KELLER:  Well, two points.
4                                    If you need to even reach the question
5                                    of whether there's ambiguity -- and we think
6                                    the term "necessary" is clear in context, it
7                                    has to mean indispensable or essential -- that
8                                    would be a term where potentially the
9                                    government in their interpretation would reach
10                                   ambiguity.
11                                   But, regardless, the major questions
12                                   doctrine is also in service of avoiding
13                                   non-delegation concerns, and the non-delegation
14                                   concerns that this Court recognized in
15                                   Industrial Union and citing Sharepoint --
16                                   JUSTICE GORSUCH:  I -- I -- I'm -- I'm
17                                   sorry to interrupt you, but that might -- that
18                                   wasn't quite my question.  I apologize if I
19                                   didn't make it clear enough.
20                                   But the government says that we only
21                                   consult those doctrines, the federalism canon
22                                   and the major questions doctrine -- I think the
23                                   Court understands what they are but only
24                                   consults them after finding a statutory
25                                   ambiguity.  Do you disagree?

1                                    MR. KELLER:  I disagree in that the
2                                    major questions doctrine is also a -- a -- a
3                                    doctrine that would avoid non-delegation
4                                    concerns.  So even if there were a clear
5                                    statutory term, non-delegation concerns and how
6                                    to interpret that statute would factor in.
7                                    Regardless, I think the term "necessary" here,
8                                    there's plenty of room to implement the major
9                                    questions doctrine there, in addition to all of
10                                   the workplace-tethered language in the plain
11                                   text and statutory context.
12                                   JUSTICE GORSUCH:  And then, secondly,
13                                   I would like to understand your argument and
14                                   your colleague's argument from Ohio, I believe
15                                   it is, why the Court should enter a stay
16                                   immediately.  I -- you've asked for immediate
17                                   relief.  Why should the Court grant immediate
18                                   relief?
19                                   MR. KELLER:  The short version is, as
20                                   soon as businesses have to put out their plans
21                                   and this takes effect, workers will quit.  That
22                                   itself will be a permanent worker displacement
23                                   that will ripple through the national economy.
24                                   So we can talk about the billions in
25                                   non-recoverable costs that the government even

1                                    concedes, and we can talk about the lost
2                                    profits and lost goodwill and lost business
3                                    reputation, and we can talk about the
4                                    businesses that are going to be put out of
5                                    business.  Our appendix at pages 375 to 80
6                                    quotes many businesses saying this would be
7                                    catastrophic, it would bankrupt our -- our
8                                    company, it would be the most devastating event
9                                    our company has ever experienced.
10                                   That's why we're here.  We're asking
11                                   for an extraordinary stay.  We understand the
12                                   gravity of the situation.  But, in balancing
13                                   the sheer size and scope of this emergency
14                                   power that is supposed to be exercised
15                                   delicately and the national economic
16                                   implications of this when states and businesses
17                                   can and have acted, we are entitled to a stay
18                                   in this posture.
19                                   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Alito?
20                                   Sorry to have gone out of order.
21                                   JUSTICE ALITO:  No, no, fine.
22                                   Mr. Keller, I just want to make sure I
23                                   understand what we should focus on here.  Is
24                                   the question whether this ETS is necessary to
25                                   protect the health of the general public, or is

1                                    it whether it is necessary to protect just
2                                    employees and not even all employees but only
3                                    unvaccinated employees, people who have chosen
4                                    independently not to be vaccinated and do not
5                                    want to be vaccinated?  Is that the proper
6                                    focus?
7                                    MR. KELLER:  Correct, the latter,
8                                    Justice Alito.  As OSHA has said, the grave
9                                    danger here is to the unvaccinated worker who
10                                   is exposed to COVID.
11                                   JUSTICE ALITO:  Thank you.
12                                   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice
13                                   Sotomayor.
14                                   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Yes, counsel.  I
15                                   -- I quibble with that in part.  The
16                                   unvaccinated worker affects other unvaccinated
17                                   workers but affects vaccinated workers.  We
18                                   have proof of that with Omicron.  And it's not
19                                   just death, but there is illness, and for many
20                                   with preexisting conditions or immunological
21                                   problems, there are severe consequences even
22                                   when vaccinated.  So I think the grave danger
23                                   is to both.
24                                   But, Mr. Fletcher, are you -- you seem
25                                   to be importing into "necessary" a concept of
Heritage Reporting Corporation

25
1                                    strict scrutiny.  Am I correct?
2                                    MR. KELLER:  No, Justice Sotomayor.
3                                    The "necessary" analysis does have to account
4                                    for alternatives, but we're not asking anything
5                                    close to a least restrictive means analysis.
6                                    What we're saying is the agency --
7                                    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  So, if
8                                    you're not, I know that your experts are
9                                    predicting catastrophes, but they've done --
10                                   experts opposed to OSHA regulations have done
11                                   the same for decades, and the catastrophes have
12                                   failed to happen.  And there are exemptions.
13                                   The Post Office -- the -- the Postal Service is
14                                   looking for them -- is looking at one of them.
15                                   I'm sorry, OSHA is looking at one from -- from
16                                   the Postal Service, and there are probably
17                                   other private and public entities who can seek
18                                   exemptions as well.
19                                   But putting all of that aside, who
20                                   makes that judgment about the seriousness of
21                                   the effect?  I always thought it was the
22                                   agency.  It's not judges.  And it's not experts
23                                   because experts have conflicting opinions.
24                                   I always thought that all we had to
25                                   look at was whether an agency had substantial

1                                    evidence before it to conclude that all of the
2                                    economic ramifications that you're speaking
3                                    about -- and this is what I think they found in
4                                    Earl Rebone.  Where am I wrong that that's an
5                                    agency judgment?  There is certainly
6                                    substantial evidence to -- to support their
7                                    judgment.  It's a very huge record they
8                                    compiled.  They looked at a massive amount of
9                                    data across many, many industries and in many,
10                                   many different states.  Please tell me why, if
11                                   we're going to issue a temporary stay -- and I
12                                   think this was Justice Breyer's question -- we
13                                   would have to accept your version of the facts
14                                   as opposed to the agency's?  Aren't we supposed
15                                   to accept the agency's?
16                                   MR. KELLER:  I think even if you
17                                   accept the agency's facts, there are now, as
18                                   Your Honor just mentioned, CDC guidance
19                                   contradicting foundational assumptions of this
20                                   ETS.  That's in our reply brief at page 7, and
21                                   Your Honor just mentioned that.
22                                   But, regard -- regardless, even OSHA
23                                   has said that 1 to 3 percent of employees will
24                                   quit.  That is significant.  Our declarations

1                                    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, yes, that
2                                    may be true.  But we are now having deaths at
3                                    an unprecedented amount.  Catching COVID keeps
4                                    people out of the workplace for extraordinary
5                                    periods of time.  And there have been proof in
6                                    certain industries, like the medical industry,
7                                    that when vaccines are mandated -- and there's
8                                    no mandate here for a vaccine.  There is a
9                                    masking mandate, no different than there is
10                                   when we tell people that if there are sparks
11                                   flying in the workplace, wear -- you have --
12                                   workers have to be provided -- have to wear a
13                                   mask.  So that's no different in my mind than
14                                   this.
15                                   So this is not a vaccine mandate.
16                                   There are costs and deaths and other things
17                                   countervailing to the fact that there might be
18                                   1 to 3 percent of workers who leave.
19                                   MR. KELLER:  And, here, vaccines have
20                                   been made available.  I also think there's a
21                                   textual clue within the OSH Act at 29 U.S.C.
22                                   655 that --
23                                   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You forget that
24                                   there are certain states now that are stopping
25                                   employers from requiring vaccines.  There are

12                                                        JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There's no
13                                                        requirement here.  It's not a vaccine mandate.
14                                                        MR. KELLER:  Well --

18                                                        JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And I don't know
19                                                        how much clearer than 651 Congress -- Congress
20                                                        could have been.  It charges OSHA with

3                                    MR. KELLER:  If Congress was going to
4                                    give an occupational health agency this type of
5                                    power to essentially regulate directly the
6                                    employee, rather than telling employers these
7                                    are the types of things that you would want to
8                                    do within your workplace, it would have had to
9                                    provide that clearly.  And my understanding was
10                                   --
11                                   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what's the
12                                   difference between this and telling employers,
13                                   where sparks are flying in the workplace, your
14                                   workers have to be -- wear a mask?
15                                   MR. KELLER:  When sparks are flying in
16                                   the workplace, that's presumably because
17                                   there's a machine that's unique to that
18                                   workplace.  That is the --
19                                   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why is the human
20                                   being not like a machine if it's spewing a
21                                   virus, blood-borne viruses?  Are you
22                                   questioning Congress's power or desire that
23                                   OSHA do this?  It already in 1991 told OSHA to

1                                    think that exactly proves our point, that
2                                    Congress knows how to enact a statute when it
3                                    wants to give OSHA power --
4                                    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It didn't enact a
5                                    statute.  OSHA proposed regulations, it didn't
6                                    act fast enough, and Congress told it to act
7                                    faster.
8                                    MR. KELLER:  And --
9                                    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So it wasn't
10                                   Congress who proposed it.  It wasn't Congress
11                                   who devised it.  Congress gave OSHA the
12                                   responsibility to do these things, and Congress
13                                   was saying get to it.
14                                   MR. KELLER:  And what Congress said in
15                                   there was not you now have statutory authority
16                                   to regulate all communicable diseases.  It was
17                                   blood-borne pathogens, and even that rule did
18                                   not mandate vaccines or widespread testing.

24                                   is, who decides?  And I think that that's

1                                    Respectfully, I -- I think it has a
2                                    different answer than the one that you give, so
3                                    I'll just sort of put a different version of it
4                                    to you, which is, you know, you're -- I'm sure
5                                    you're right that there are all kinds of public
6                                    health and economic tradeoffs that have to be
7                                    made in a policy like this, all kinds of
8                                    judgments on the public health side, on the
9                                    economic side, how those two things ought to be
10                                   balanced against each other.
11                                   So who decides?  Should it be the
12                                   agency full of expert policymakers and
13                                   completely politically accountable through the
14                                   President?  This is not the kind of policy in
15                                   which there's no political accountability.  If
16                                   people like this policy, they'll go to the
17                                   polls and vote it that way.  If people don't
18                                   like it, they'll vote that way.
19                                   This is a publicly -- a politically
20                                   accountable policy.  It also has the virtue of
21                                   expertise.  So, on the one hand, the agency
22                                   with their political leadership can decide.
23                                   Or, on the other hand, courts can decide.
24                                   Courts are not politically accountable.  Courts
25                                   have not been elected.  Courts have no

4                                    MR. KELLER:  Congress and states and
5                                    governors wielding emergency power are the ones
6                                    that have the power -- and we acknowledge
7                                    that -- over vaccines.  The idea that OSHA
8                                    would be the agency in the federal government
9                                    that's not even under the Department of Health
10                                   and Human Services, that does not have
11                                   expertise over communicable diseases like the
12                                   FDA or CDC maybe, that would just be a very odd
13                                   place for Congress to large -- to lodge such a
14                                   sweeping power over the American people.
15                                   JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, OSHA has a lot
16                                   of expertise about workforces and about the
17                                   dangers that workforces can confront individual
18                                   employees with.  And I'm sure OSHA also talked
19                                   to other agencies within the federal government
20                                   to consider public health issues and brought
21                                   that knowledge to bear as well with its
22                                   knowledge of -- of how workplaces function and
23                                   -- and, again, came out with a -- a
24                                   well-supported policy that has political

1                                    accountability that one could wish for.
2                                    And why is it that courts would
3                                    displace that judgment and say it is up to us
4                                    to decide about vaccination policy in the
5                                    employment settings of this country?
6                                    MR. KELLER:  Well, first of all, what
7                                    OSHA did here was not an industry-by-industry
8                                    analysis.  I mean, the line it drew, for
9                                    instance, with the 100 or more employee lines,
10                                   they said they were doing that because they
11                                   thought the larger companies were the ones that
12                                   had the administrative capacity to do it.  It
13                                   wasn't because they were denser working
14                                   environments.  You could have a company with a
15                                   hundred employees and every single person is
16                                   working somewhere else.
17                                   Even the narrow exception that they
18                                   have raised, even they say that 9 percent of
19                                   landscapers and 5 percent of highway workers
20                                   are the only ones that would qualify for their
21                                   exclusively working outside exemption.  So even
22                                   occupations in which you would think someone is
23                                   almost exclusively working outside, they are
24                                   still covered by this ETS.

6                                    Kavanaugh.
7                                    JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  I want to follow
8                                    up on Justice Kagan's who decides question
9                                    because I do think that gets to the -- the
10                                   heart of this.
11                                   You're relying on the major questions
12                                   canon in saying that when an agency wants to
13                                   issue a major rule that resolves a major
14                                   question, it can't rely on statutory language
15                                   that is cryptic, vague, oblique, ambiguous.
16                                   But the critique of -- of that canon
17                                   and the difficulty in applying it is figuring
18                                   out when something is major enough.  We've
19                                   applied it five or six times in the last 40
20                                   years, and you know the cases, and they're
21                                   important, and we'll talk about them, I'm sure,
22                                   as the argument goes on.
23                                   But how -- how -- what should we look
24                                   at to say this one is the kind of rule that
25                                   rises to the level of the benzene rule or the

2                                    What -- what should we look at?
3                                    MR. KELLER:  So Alabama realtors just
4                                    said the sheer size and scope.  Size would
5                                    account for the overall economic impact.  This
6                                    covers 1.8 million establishments.  The number
7                                    of people affected would be another factor.
8                                    This covers 84 million or two-thirds of the
9                                    private workforce.  The amount of money, King
10                                   versus Burwell said billions in cost, and,
11                                   here, we have that even conceded by OSHA.
12                                   The scope also.  All of the 10 prior
13                                   ETSs that OSHA has done, none of them have
14                                   mandated vaccines.  None of them have mandated
15                                   widespread testing.  Only one in June even
16                                   dealt with COVID.  The rest were all workplace
17                                   toxins, and most of those challenges were
18                                   upheld -- or, sorry, most of those challenges
19                                   were vindicated by the courts.
20                                   And so the scope of what the agency
21                                   has done before, in addition to the widespread
22                                   effects, those would be the factors that you'd
23                                   analyze.
24                                   Also, is this a profound and earnest

1                                    vast political and economic significance?  I
2                                    don't at this point believe that the federal
3                                    government is contesting that this absolutely
4                                    satisfies that.
5                                    JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  And one follow-up
6                                    question.  Suppose it is major enough, so
7                                    accept that position for the sake of this
8                                    question, suppose the statutory language is
9                                    general, broad, but doesn't speak specifically
10                                   to the issue in question, but it is general and
11                                   broad language.
12                                   How do we sort out -- so you don't
13                                   necessarily say the language is ambiguous.  But
14                                   it also doesn't speak specifically to the
15                                   issue.  How -- how would you suggest we sort
16                                   out that kind of question?  I realize you're
17                                   going to say this language is different, but
18                                   how would you sort out that kind of question?
19                                   MR. KELLER:  You look at the plain
20                                   text.  From Brown & Williamson, we know you'd
21                                   also look at the statutory context, and I also
22                                   think the statutory context here is incredibly
23                                   important.
24                                   When you have the distinction between

1                                    this was the dialogue earlier with Justice
2                                    Thomas about necessary versus reasonably

5                                    within the federal government, the fact that
6                                    this is within the Department of Labor rather
7                                    than Department of Human and Health -- Health
8                                    and Human Services, also King versus Burwell
9                                    too on, is this the agency that has expertise
10                                   over communicable diseases?  No, it's not.
11                                   JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Do you think the
12                                   agency could do this under its general power
13                                   then?
14                                   MR. KELLER:  No, I do not think that
15                                   the agency could do an economy-wide
16                                   vaccine-or-testing mandate across the entire
17                                   economy.  It has never done that even through
18                                   its regular power.  It didn't do that in June
19                                   in an ETS targeting healthcare workers,
20                                   arguably the most heightened high-risk
21                                   workplace.

1                                    to return to the discussion you were having
2                                    with both the Chief Justice and Justice Kagan
3                                    earlier about whether the vaccine-or-test
4                                    requirement addresses -- is necessary to
5                                    address a grave danger in the workplace.
6                                    I think you would be hard pressed to
7                                    contest the Chief's point that there are some
8                                    workplaces in which the danger to employees is
9                                    different than that that they face out in the
10                                   world.  A meat-packing plant or a healthcare --
11                                   the dentist.
12                                   And I think what you're saying --
13                                   well, I think this is what you're saying and I
14                                   want to be sure that I understand it, that I'm
15                                   correct.  I think what you're saying is that
16                                   even if there are some industries or some
17                                   people who would face a great risk and this
18                                   might be necessary to address that risk, so, in
19                                   other words, if OSHA had adopted a more
20                                   targeted rule, you might not be contesting that
21                                   or you would not be contesting that, that the
22                                   problem here is its scope and that there's no
23                                   differentiation between the risk faced by
24                                   unvaccinated 22-year-olds and unvaccinated

4                                    So is that the distinction that you're
5                                    making?  You're not disputing what Justice
6                                    Kagan said, that, you know, this is a grave
7                                    danger and that in some circumstances, this
8                                    rule might be necessary, but just the scope of
9                                    it makes it different?
10                                   MR. KELLER:  That's right, Justice
11                                   Barrett.  But -- but I just want to be very
12                                   clear about this.  Wherever that line is, this
13                                   ETS is so far beyond that line.  Congress
14                                   identified and even OSHA identified, for
15                                   instance, certain healthcare scenarios.  For
16                                   instance, you know, if you're treating COVID
17                                   patients or you're a scientist in a laboratory
18                                   handling COVID samples and researching them, of
19                                   course, that's going to be a very different
20                                   case.
21                                   But, here, what OSHA did was
22                                   economy-wide.  It said it --
23                                   JUSTICE BARRETT:  Well, I understand
24                                   that.  And you're saying that that's the
25                                   problem.  You're not contesting that if we were

2                                    meat-packing plant, you're not contesting that
3                                    OSHA could rely on its emergency power to
4                                    impose this kind of requirement in that
5                                    context.
6                                                                                      MR. KELLER:  That's right.  I would
7                                    still want to know what their explanation was
8                                    --
9                                    JUSTICE BARRETT:  Sure.
10                                   MR. KELLER:                                       -- and all of the
11                                   substantial evidence, but, yeah, of course,
12                                   that's a very different case.  And I know
13                                   that's always not a satisfactory answer.  But,
14                                   here, this ETS is so far beyond healthcare
15                                   workers and what Congress identified in the
16                                   rescue plan as truly high-risk workplaces.
17                                                                                     JUSTICE BARRETT:  Right.  So you're
18                                   saying that when we take the definition of
19                                   "necessary," particularly when contrasted with
20                                   "reasonably necessary" and the general grant of
21                                   authority, that it means something more and
22                                   that when we're looking at grave danger, there
23                                   had to be a more targeted industry-by-industry
24                                   analysis?
25                                   MR. KELLER:  Yes.

1                                    JUSTICE BARRETT:  Okay.  And a
2                                    follow-up.  Would you be here making these same
3                                    arguments if this were just a masking and
4                                    testing requirement and not the vaccine portion
5                                    of it?
6                                    MR. KELLER:  Yes, I think that
7                                    mandatory testing is still a mandatory medical
8                                    procedure.  OSHA has never, even in a regular
9                                    rule, done a blanket, widespread testing regime
10                                   over 84 million Americans.
11                                   JUSTICE BARRETT:  What if it was just
12                                   masking?
13                                   MR. KELLER:  I think we -- I don't
14                                   think OSHA has the ability to set by emergency
15                                   rule nationwide COVID policy.  You know, the
16                                   more that we back out of this and the more we
17                                   say, well, if it's not an emergency rule or if
18                                   it's targeted to a particular workplace, you
19                                   know, I think there can be debates about that.
20                                   But, as long as they're trying to set a
21                                   blanket-wide -- economy-wide policy by an
22                                   emergency rule, OSHA does not have that power.
23                                   JUSTICE BARRETT:  Thank you.

7                                    ON BEHALF OF THE APPLICANTS IN NO. 21A247
8                                    MR. FLOWERS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and
9                                    may it please the Court:
10                                   OSHA typically identifies a workplace
11                                   danger and then regulates it.  But, here, the
12                                   President decided to regulate a danger and then
13                                   told OSHA to find a work-related basis for
14                                   doing so.  This resulted in the vaccine
15                                   mandate, a blunderbuss rule, nationwide in
16                                   scope, that requires the same thing of all
17                                   covered employers, regardless of the other
18                                   steps they've taken to protect employees,
19                                   regardless of the nature of their workplaces,
20                                   regardless of their employees' risk factors,
21                                   and regardless of local conditions that state
22                                   and local officials are far better positioned
23                                   to understand and accommodate.
24                                   So sweeping a rule is not necessary to
25                                   protect employees from a grave danger as the

1                                    emergency provision requires.  And I want to be
2                                    clear that states share OSHA's desire to bring
3                                    this pandemic to a close, but the agency cannot
4                                    pursue that laudable goal unlawfully.
5                                    I welcome your questions.
6                                    JUSTICE THOMAS:  So you're saying,
7                                    Mr. Flowers, that the first step in OSHA's
8                                    regulation is to identify the workforce, the
9                                    problem in that workforce, and then regulate
10                                   that?
11                                   MR. FLOWERS:  That is typically how
12                                   OSHA proceeds.  I don't know that there's a
13                                   requirement that says they must do that, but I
14                                   think part of the problems we're seeing with
15                                   this rule is it's not truly intended to
16                                   regulate a workplace danger; it's -- it's --
17                                   it's a danger that we all face simply as a
18                                   matter of waking up in the morning.
19                                   JUSTICE THOMAS:  Well, but --
20                                   MR. FLOWERS:  And I -- and I -- I'm
21                                   sorry.
22                                   JUSTICE THOMAS:  I'm sorry to
23                                   interrupt you, but I -- the other part of my
24                                   question is, can a danger be so acute in the
25                                   society that it is brought into the workforce

1                                    and could hence be regulated by its mere
2                                    presence there and by the fact that it is so
3                                    acute?
4                                    MR. FLOWERS:  It -- I think what they
5                                    need -- let -- all right.  Let me answer this
6                                    in two steps.  I can first define what we mean
7                                    by "work-related danger" and then talk about
8                                    how that applies here, and I think that'll get
9                                    to your question.
10                                   So, in terms of what we mean by
11                                   "work-related danger," I think one way to think
12                                   about that is, has the employer done or failed
13                                   to do something that creates a risk the
14                                   employee faces?  And then the problem with
15                                   applying that here is, if you look at their own
16                                   explanation for what the risk is -- this is at
17                                   61411 of the Federal Register -- they say the
18                                   reason there's a risk in every workplace is you
19                                   interact, you come into contact with people at
20                                   the workplace.
21                                   When you define the risk that broadly,
22                                   that is not something that's arising out of the
23                                   workplace.  That's a risk we face when we wake
24                                   up, when we're with our families, when we stop
25                                   to get coffee on the way to work, at work, when

3                                    So this kind of goes to Justice
4                                    Barrett's question, I believe, that if they
5                                    were to focus on a risk arising out of a -- a
6                                    particular aspect of the workplace that creates
7                                    a -- a risk of a different nature, like being
8                                    packed closely together in a meat-packing
9                                    plant, that could fairly be described as a
10                                   work-related danger.
11                                   JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Flowers --
12                                   MR. FLOWERS:  But this cannot.
13                                   JUSTICE KAGAN:  Sorry.  Sorry to
14                                   interrupt.  Do you know of any workplaces that
15                                   have not fundamentally transformed themselves
16                                   in the last two years?  I mean, maybe like --
17                                   MR. FLOWERS:  I --
18                                   JUSTICE KAGAN:                                    -- landscapers, they
19                                   work outside.  But, I mean, this idea that
20                                   there are only a few select workplaces that are
21                                   affected by COVID, I would have thought every
22                                   workplace has been affected by COVID.  Every
23                                   workplace sent their workers home.  Every
24                                   workplace had to make adjustments to the way
25                                   they do their business.

1                                    I'm trying to figure out, like, why
2                                    this is a blunderbuss approach when everybody
3                                    knows from living their normal lives that every
4                                    workplace has been affected by this, save for,
5                                    you know, a few here and there.
6                                    MR. FLOWERS:  So the way I would
7                                    answer that is to say just about every
8                                    workplace has been affected, but that doesn't
9                                    mean the work is arising from the workplace.
10                                   To take another example, if we look at
11                                   terrorism, there's some risk of terrorism that
12                                   we face when we wake up in the morning.  We
13                                   face it at home, in public, and at work.  And
14                                   we adjusted to that after 9/11.  If you see
15                                   something, say something.  Ideas like that.
16                                   Now the fact that you face that work
17                                   -- that risk when you go to work doesn't make
18                                   it a workplace risk.  It means it's an
19                                   ever-present risk.
20                                   JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, why -- why not?
21                                   I mean, this is a -- the combination of lots of
22                                   people all going into one indoor space and
23                                   having to deal with each other for eight hours,
24                                   10 hours, however many hours a day, in those
25                                   settings, the combination of the environment

1                                    and the people that are in that environment
2                                    create a risk, I would think.  I mean, tell me
3                                    if I'm wrong about this.  I would think that
4                                    workplace risk is about the greatest, least
5                                    controllable risk with respect to COVID that
6                                    any person has.
7                                    You know, everything else a person can
8                                    control.  You can go to the baseball game or
9                                    not go to the baseball game.  You can decide
10                                   who to go to the baseball game with.  But you
11                                   can't do any of that in workplaces.  You have
12                                   to be there.  You have to be there for eight
13                                   hours a day.  You have to be there in the exact
14                                   environment that the workplace is set up with.
15                                   And you have to be there with a bunch of people
16                                   you don't know and who might be completely
17                                   irresponsible.
18                                   Where else do people have a greater
19                                   risk than at the workplace?
20                                   MR. FLOWERS:  Well, I think one thing,
21                                   with their families, which they have to spend
22                                   even more time with, especially if they have
23                                   children going to school and things of that
24                                   nature.  But, in response to does the risk -- I
25                                   mean, of course, the risk arises at the

1                                    workplace, but it's important to focus on the
2                                    risk they're talking about.  They're not
3                                    talking about jobs where people do congregate
4                                    in settings like that that changes the nature
5                                    of the risk.
6                                    They say every single workplace where
7                                    people come inside for even a little bit is
8                                    covered.  And so they've defined the risk to
9                                    mean simple human contact.  And it could be no
10                                   more contact than you have at the grocery store
11                                   or when you drop your kids off at school or
12                                   when you go to a -- a friend's house.
13                                   JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, Mr. Flowers, in
14                                   fact --
15                                   MR. FLOWERS:  And that's the problem.
16                                   We're not --
17                                   JUSTICE KAGAN:                                    -- in fact, what --
18                                   what this rule does is it says we're not going
19                                   to regulate some people.  People who work
20                                   outdoors, forget about it.  People who work
21                                   alone, we don't have to worry about them.  But
22                                   people who work in the way that lots and lots
23                                   and lots of people work, which is surrounded by
24                                   other people in indoor spaces, you know, with

2                                    settings, you know, that's where the greatest
3                                    risk is.  Not just that's where the risk of
4                                    ordinary life is.  That is, in fact, where the
5                                    greatest risk is.
6                                    MR. FLOWERS:  And if they had taken
7                                    that approach, they would have a much better
8                                    argument, but they don't because there are many
9                                    jobs here, including, for example, landscapers,
10                                   who may spend a little bit of time inside, five
11                                   minutes a day, to get the keys or punch their
12                                   time card --
13                                   JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, is this right?
14                                   Is this right?
15                                   MR. FLOWERS:                                      -- but who are covered
16                                   --
17                                   JUSTICE BREYER:  What this says, what
18                                   I -- I mean, my law clerks have been busy
19                                   beavers on this case, I promise you, and what
20                                   they have on this issue is that there are
21                                   exceptions here.  There aren't exceptions
22                                   business by business, but there are exceptions,
23                                   those who work from home, alone, or
24                                   substantially outdoors, or those who can show

2                                    workplaces as safe and healthful as the ETA --
3                                    as the ETS can obtain a variance, okay?
4                                    So they did make some distinctions.
5                                    MR. FLOWERS:  Well --
6                                    JUSTICE BREYER:  Not industry by
7                                    industry, but my question really is, that I'd
8                                    like to turn this to, is a stay.  You heard
9                                    what I asked.  I mean, you know, 750 million
10                                   new cases yesterday or close to that is a lot.
11                                   I don't mean to be facetious.
12                                   But that -- that -- that's why I said
13                                   I would find it, you know, unbelievable that it
14                                   could be in the public interest to suddenly
15                                   stop these vaccinations.  And the only answer
16                                   that was given was a lot of people will quit.
17                                   Well, OSHA considered that.  My
18                                   wonderful law clerk has 61,475, 63,422, 61,466,
19                                   61,474 and 475, those are pages.  I don't think
20                                   you should read all 61,000, but, nonetheless,
21                                   there are at least five or 10 pages where they
22                                   went into this.  And they said, in our view,
23                                   hmm, yeah, that's right, some people may quit,
24                                   maybe 3 percent.  But more may quit when they
25                                   discover they have to work together with

1                                    unvaccinated others because that means they may
2                                    get the disease.  Okay?
3                                    And more will quit because they'll be
4                                    -- maybe die or maybe they'll be in the
5                                    hospital or maybe they'll be sick and have to
6                                    stay home for two weeks.  So they did the pros
7                                    and cons.
8                                    So I'd like to take Justice Kagan's
9                                    questions, which I think I share on the merits,
10                                   and just ask you, are you asking us both still
11                                   to issue a stay today, tomorrow, Monday, and
12                                   why, if you are?
13                                   MR. FLOWERS:  We are seeking an
14                                   immediate -- thanks for the question.  We are
15                                   seeking an immediate stay.
16                                   As an initial matter, I think Alabama
17                                   Realtors takes their argument about the

20                                   then it's not in the public interest and it's
21                                   proper to enjoin it.
22                                   Now the Court may say -- or stay it,
23                                   rather.  The Court may decide that there's a
24                                   better way to unwind the illegal action than a
25                                   judicial action, and I think that's what

3                                    But what it can't do is say we judge
4                                    that these are very -- in our view, this
5                                    illegal action will lead to good effects, and
6                                    so we will allow that to happen.
7                                    To Justice Kagan's question about the
8                                    who decides point, Congress tell -- told us who
9                                    decides at 2112 -- 28 USC 2112 says that courts
10                                   can issue stays, and the reason for that is
11                                   they recognize that this was without notice and
12                                   comment, and unless the courts could step in to
13                                   abate illegal actions, nobody would be able to
14                                   do so.
15                                   And that's especially important here,
16                                   where the -- the action they're, in our view,
17                                   mandating but at least strongly encouraging,
18                                   vaccination, cannot be undone.

20                                   interest is that one awkwardness of this
21                                   situation is that the ETS is focused on what
22                                   was really a different pandemic.  It's all
23                                   about the Delta variant.  Now we are on to

10                                   that makes it very hard to look at the numbers

17                                   numbers show that Omicron is as deadly and
18                                   causes as much serious disease in the

21                                   We have more affected people in the country
22                                   today than we had a year ago in January.
23                                   We have hospitals that are almost at

7                                    is not a vaccine mandate, and -- and requiring
8                                    masking and requiring isolation of people who
9                                    have tested for COVID, because none of you have

11                                   something that should be self-evident to the
12                                   world but is not, which is, if you're sick, you
13                                   can't come into work.  The workplace can't let
14                                   you into the workplace and you shouldn't go on
15                                   unmasked.
16                                   Tell me what's irrational about rules
17                                   of that nature when it is the workplace that
18                                   puts you into contact with people that will put
19                                   you at risk.

2                                    the police power to protect the health and
3                                    welfare of workers, you seem to be saying the
4                                    states can do it, but you're saying the federal
5                                    government can't even though it's facing the
6                                    same crisis in interstate commerce that states

10                                   but the federal government wouldn't.
11                                   MR. FLOWERS:  The federal government
12                                   has no police power if we're asking about that.
13                                   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Oh, it does have
14                                   power with respect to protecting the health and
15                                   safety of workers.  We have -- we have --
16                                   accept the constitutionality of OSHA.
17                                   MR. FLOWERS:  Yes.  I took you to be
18                                   asking if they had a police power to protect
19                                   public health.  They -- they absolutely have
20                                   the --
21                                   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, they have a
22                                   police power to protect workers.
23                                   MR. FLOWERS:  I would not call it a
24                                   police power.  I think the Commerce Clause

11                                   been some talk -- suggestion or at least it
12                                   seems to be implied that the vaccinations are
13                                   efficacious in preventing some degree of
14                                   infection to others.
15                                   Could you talk about that,
16                                   particularly as I remember in the filings that
17                                   the 18 to -- that the younger workers, the
18                                   20-year-olds who are unvaccinated are actually
19                                   safer than the older workers who are
20                                   vaccinated.  So there are obviously some

1                                    promoters of vaccination because they do stop

3                                    In terms of stopping infection and
4                                    transmission, at least with the current
5                                    variant, it appears the numbers suggest to be
6                                    far less effective.  But -- but -- and then, in
7                                    terms of the comparison you were asking about,
8                                    I think it's hard to define "grave," what the
9                                    grave danger in the abstract.  What we can at
10                                   least mandate or at least demand from the
11                                   agency is internal consistency.
12                                   And if you look at their own data, the
13                                   CDC data from the last week of October,
14                                   unvaccinated individuals 18 to 29 were as
15                                   likely to die as vaccinated 50 to 64-year-olds
16                                   and five times less likely to die than
17                                   vaccinated 65 and up.  Hospitalization was --
18                                   between 18 and 49, that's not even just the
19                                   young -- was about as likely as vaccinated 65
20                                   and up.
21                                   If you look at the Griffin study that
22                                   they cite at 61,418 of the federal -- of the

24                                   both had low risks of death and ICU.

6                                    vaccinated individuals who are 65 or older are
7                                    twice as likely to die as unvaccinated
8                                    individuals 18 to 49.  And keep in mind that's
9                                    18 to 49, not 18 to 29.  So that's -- it would
10                                   probably be even more skewed if you looked at
11                                   the -- the younger demographic.
12                                   JUSTICE THOMAS:  Would the State of
13                                   Ohio have the -- in your -- I'm not saying this
14                                   would be an approach you would take, but we --
15                                   you had earlier a discussion about whether or
16                                   not the federal government had police powers in
17                                   the workforce, and you suggested that the state
18                                   has those police powers.
19                                   Could the State of Ohio do what you
20                                   say OSHA cannot do?
21                                   MR. FLOWERS:  In terms of -- yes, my
22                                   position is the State of Ohio at least could
23                                   mandate vaccinations not only for workers but
24                                   for all individuals.
25                                   Now I think that's an important point

1                                    to stress is we're talking here as though OSHA
2                                    is the only entity that can regulate this, an
3                                    agency that no one thought had anything to do
4                                    with the pandemic until months, if not years,
5                                    into it.
6                                    But we have the states and we have
7                                    private businesses and they're not sitting on
8                                    their hands.  And -- and individuals are doing
9                                    things to try and bring this pandemic to a
10                                   close or at least learn to live with it.
11                                   Indeed, this Court, without any requirement
12                                   from OSHA, has found ways to -- to safely
13                                   conduct business.
14                                   JUSTICE THOMAS:  I think my point is
15                                   rather that there seemed to be -- seems to be a
16                                   suggestion that this is all or nothing, that
17                                   the other governmental bodies do not have
18                                   police powers to regulate certain activities.
19                                   And you've answered my question.  Thank you.

23                                   just curious.  I was searching for an example.
24                                   Universal risk inside and outside the

1                                    regulate it?  Can OSHA regulate fire risks?
2                                                                                      MR. FLOWERS:  Yes.  We don't draw the
3                                    distinction between in -- in the workplace and
4                                    out of work.
5                                    JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  If they can
6                                    regulate fire risks, then why can't they
7                                    regulate this risk?
8                                                                                      MR. FLOWERS:  Because the difference
9                                    with the fire is that there's something about
10                                   the workplace, for example, not providing
11                                   safety equipment to put out the -- put out the
12                                   fire.
13                                   JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, people throw
14                                   matches.
15                                   MR. FLOWERS:  They smoke.
16                                                                                     JUSTICE BREYER:  They smoke.  Sometime
17                                   -- oh, they shouldn't, but they do.  And -- and
18                                   -- or they throw a match or they -- you know, a
19                                   lot of causes, such as --
20                                   MR. FLOWERS:  Right.  That's right.
21                                   JUSTICE BREYER:                                   -- fall --
22                                   crushing -- crushing people into -- not
23                                   crushing them.  They come in the same room.
24                                   You understand the point.  Okay.  The
25                                   difference is?

2                                    JUSTICE BREYER:  Say it again so I
3                                    catch it.
4                                    MR. FLOWERS:  Sure.  I want to be -- I
5                                    want to be very clear about this.  We accept
6                                    the line that's been drawn for every important
7                                    industry that simply the fact that a risk
8                                    exists outside the workplace doesn't mean you
9                                    can't address it when it's inside the
10                                   workplace.
11                                   What we dispute is the idea that a
12                                   risk that is ever present in all places can be
13                                   regulated simply because it's also in the
14                                   workplace.
15                                   And so you can regulate -- to be
16                                   clear, OSHA could regulate COVID-19 in the
17                                   workplace when the employer does something like
18                                   packing individuals very closely together in a
19                                   poorly ventilated area that -- that -- that
20                                   enhances or changes the nature of the risk, I
21                                   should say.  But that's not the risk they say
22                                   they're regulating.  Again, 61,411 of the
23                                   Federal Register, they say the risk is you'll
24                                   come into contact with individuals.
25                                   And the risk of encountering an

2                                    home, at work, and everywhere else.
3                                    CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Alito.
4                                    JUSTICE ALITO:  I want to come back to
5                                    the question I asked Mr. Keller in light of all
6                                    that's been said this morning so far about
7                                    public health, about the value of vaccine to --
8                                    vaccines to the general public, because I want
9                                    to make sure I understand precisely what the
10                                   question is before us.
11                                   And what I took from Mr. Keller's
12                                   answer, which seems to be right, is that the
13                                   question is whether there is a grave danger for
14                                   unvaccinated workers, period.
15                                   What the Secretary said was "employees
16                                   who are unvaccinated are in grave danger from
17                                   SARS COVID virus, but employees who are fully
18                                   vaccinated are not."  So the -- the purpose --
19                                   if this is to be sustained, it has to be on the
20                                   ground that it presents a grave danger to
21                                   unvaccinated workers who have chosen to be
22                                   unvaccinated.
23                                   That's my understanding of the issue,
24                                   but maybe I haven't understood it correctly.
25                                   Is that your understanding?  And I'll ask the

2                                    least I hope she will address it.
3                                    MR. FLOWERS:  That is my
4                                    understanding.  And I don't see how there could
5                                    be another understanding because the emergency
6                                    provision specifically says that such emergency
7                                    standard, meaning the precise one at issue,
8                                    must be necessary to protect employees from the
9                                    danger at issue.  So the broad societal effects
10                                   are not -- are not at issue.
11                                   JUSTICE ALITO:  And protection of
12                                   vaccinated employees, who may face some danger
13                                   of contracting the virus, was not the basis for
14                                   this rule, is that correct?
15                                   MR. FLOWERS:  Correct.  And I would go
16                                   further and say they cannot rely at all on the
17                                   risk to vaccinated workers because they
18                                   concluded -- this is 61,419 of the Federal
19                                   Register -- that no one who's vaccinated is --
20                                   is in grave danger.
21                                   JUSTICE ALITO:  Thank you.

1                                    pointed to young people who had a different --
2                                    or had the same death rate as vaccinated older
3                                    people.
4                                    But the point is that it's not the
5                                    risk to the individual that's at question; it's
6                                    that risk plus the risk to others.  And
7                                    unvaccinated people -- and the agency has shown
8                                    in its studies that unvaccinated people affect
9                                    other unvaccinated people.  And they vary in
10                                   age and can be of ages and of conditions where
11                                   the effect will be serious, if not death.  So
12                                   we're not talking -- I -- I -- I don't know how
13                                   comparing apples to oranges in terms of the
14                                   risk factors makes any sense.
15                                   But, secondly, if the grave risk is to
16                                   unvaccinated people, then how do we take that
17                                   out of the equation, that it's not the risk
18                                   just to them but the risk that they pose to
19                                   others, including unvaccinated people?
20                                   MR. FLOWERS:  So I'll -- I'll answer
21                                   in two steps.  On the apples to oranges, I
22                                   think it's vital because their -- they have to
23                                   be internally consistent.  And their own logic
24                                   is that nobody who's vaccinated faces a grave
25                                   danger.  So unvaccinated folks of certain ages

2                                    hospitalization, that has -- that is relevant
3                                    to calculating --
4                                    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But lower risk
5                                    doesn't --
6                                    MR. FLOWERS:                                      -- the overall grave
7                                    danger.
8                                    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                                -- lower risk
9                                    doesn't mean no risk.  And lower risk can go
10                                   into the calculus of saying I -- we see -- and
11                                   that's what they said -- the risk to
12                                   unvaccinated people of all ages and all
13                                   conditions, and when you remain unmasked or
14                                   unvaccinated, you put yourself at risk, but you
15                                   put others.
16                                   MR. FLOWERS:  Right.
17                                   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Others,
18                                   unvaccinated people at risk and people who are
19                                   vaccinated.  They may be at a lesser risk, but
20                                   the grave risk remains to people of all ages
21                                   and conditions that are unvaccinated.
22                                   MR. FLOWERS:  Right, but -- but the
23                                   problem is they've defined numerical
24                                   probabilities that are equal to be grave in one
25                                   case and not grave in the other, and that is

3                                    it's unclear the degree to which vaccinations
4                                    reduce transmission.  They appear to have a
5                                    positive effect, and they appear, at least with
6                                    Delta and previous variants, to stop
7                                    contracting it in the first place.  So, again,
8                                    if you look at the American Commitment

10                                   that -- that the numbers are going to be
11                                   comparable when it comes to the Omicron
12                                   variant.

14                                   JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Flowers, just
15                                   continuing on that, if I understand your
16                                   answers to Justice Thomas and to Justice
17                                   Sotomayor, you basically said a couple things.
18                                   You said:  Well, you know, we understand that
19                                   18- to 29-year-olds, even though they're not
20                                   going to die or wind up with very serious
21                                   injuries, that they can spread.  You don't --
22                                   you don't doubt that, that those people spread
23                                   to other people who might be more vulnerable?
24                                   You don't doubt that, right?
25                                   MR. FLOWERS:  That's right, but the

1                                    problem for -- for --
2                                    JUSTICE KAGAN:  Okay.  So just -- I --
3                                    I'm sorry to cut you off, but I just wanted to
4                                    state that as, like, the premise.  And then the
5                                    question is:  Well, you said, well, the agency
6                                    itself says that the danger is to other
7                                    unvaccinated people, older people,
8                                    immunocompromised people, whatever.  And -- and
9                                    -- and you seem to be saying that because it's
10                                   to other unvaccinated people, kind of they
11                                   assumed the risk and the agency's power runs
12                                   out.  Is that what you're saying?
13                                   Because I don't know about that kind
14                                   of doctrine in the OSH Act or any place else in
15                                   administrative law, that because you can say
16                                   that, you know, somebody would prefer not to be
17                                   regulated, the agency loses its power.
18                                   MR. FLOWERS:  That's not -- that's not
19                                   quite the point we're making.  It's -- one --
20                                   it goes to two points.  The first is necessity.
21                                   So, if everyone who's vaccinated is not in
22                                   grave danger, then a narrower solution is, if
23                                   they think have the power to vaccinate, to
24                                   require the people in grave danger to be
25                                   vaccinated, and they are -- they are removed

1                                    from the grave danger and the other individuals
2                                    are -- are not affected.  So I think that's the
3                                    key point there.
4                                    JUSTICE KAGAN:  Okay.  Thank you.

7                                    JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Mr. Flowers, I'd
8                                    like to return to the question of -- of who
9                                    decides.  And I think we've all kind of come to
10                                   the point where we all agree that states have
11                                   -- have a wide police power under our
12                                   constitutional system that Congress has to
13                                   regulate consistent with the Commerce Clause
14                                   and -- and make the major decisions while
15                                   agencies can do the work that Congress has
16                                   given them to do but not other kinds of work.
17                                   And the major questions doctrine kind of
18                                   regulates that interaction between Congress and
19                                   agencies.
20                                   So it's not that judges are supposed
21                                   to decide some question of public health.  It's
22                                   about regulating the rules of the system to
23                                   ensure that the appropriate party does.
24                                   And so the question in my mind really
25                                   turns a lot on the major questions doctrine in

1                                    this case.  Is this one that has been given to
2                                    the agencies to decide or one that Congress has
3                                    to make as a major question under our federal
4                                    system?  And I haven't heard a lot of
5                                    discussion about that.
6                                    The Solicitor General says that the
7                                    major questions issue only comes into play when
8                                    a statute's ambiguous, and I'd like to give you
9                                    an opportunity to explain your view.
10                                   MR. FLOWERS:  I -- I -- I think you
11                                   can view the major -- the major question
12                                   doctrine, the phrase is sometimes used in
13                                   different contexts, and sometimes it is used as
14                                   kind of an ambiguity clarifier, an elephants in
15                                   mouse holes point.
16                                   But another way to look at it is
17                                   something of a constitutional doubt canon where
18                                   we recognize that although our non-delegation
19                                   doctrine is not especially robust today, there
20                                   are limits on the amount of authority that
21                                   Congress can -- can give away.
22                                   And with respect to these major
23                                   questions that are going to affect people from
24                                   coast to coast and cost, you know, millions and
25                                   millions of dollars and potentially many jobs

1                                    and potentially infect -- affect public health,
2                                    we would expect Congress -- we would demand
3                                    Congress to at least speak clearly before we
4                                    will say an agency can exercise that power and
5                                    therefore before we're into the non-delegation
6                                    issue.
7                                    I -- I do want to stress
8                                    non-delegation.  I mean, if they're right about
9                                    work-related danger, because I understand their
10                                   rule, it's any danger you could possibly face
11                                   at work.  A grave danger is any danger that
12                                   could even conceivably result in death,
13                                   "necessary" means useful, and through a
14                                   temporary and emergency standard, you can
15                                   require permanent abatement.
16                                   If you put all that together, this is
17                                   among the broadest and most standardless
18                                   delegations of authority to an agency in the
19                                   United States Code.

1                                    present here, especially in an emergency
2                                    situation.
3                                    So, as I understand it, you're
4                                    invoking the major questions doctrine and your
5                                    statutory argument to say that based on the
6                                    Constitution's separation of powers, Congress
7                                    must act or the states must act and OSHA lacks
8                                    authority under the current statutes to do
9                                    this.
10                                   That's your basic pitch, I think.
11                                   MR. FLOWERS:  I -- I think so as long
12                                   as "this" means the vaccine mandate.  We're not
13                                   -- we're not disputing that they can regulate
14                                   COVID-19 to some degree.
15                                   JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Okay.  Yes, that's
16                                   what I meant by "this."  I want to give you an
17                                   opportunity to explain the value of insisting
18                                   on that congressional action for something like
19                                   this at the federal level in an emergency
20                                   situation and explain why we shouldn't defer
21                                   more to the executive or defer to the executive
22                                   in what has been characterized, I think
23                                   appropriately, as -- as a crisis or an
24                                   emergency kind of situation.
25                                   What's the value of insisting on that

1                                    here?
2                                    MR. FLOWERS:  Well, one -- one value
3                                    of it is that when there's an emergency, it's
4                                    especially important that it be a considered,
5                                    thoughtful process, and legislation is more
6                                    likely to yield that.  And in an emergency,
7                                    you're more likely to get broad agreement on --
8                                    on certain principles that can be enacted
9                                    through Congress.  And, indeed, Congress has
10                                   taken many steps to ensure that there are to
11                                   address COVID-19.
12                                   JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Thank you.
13                                   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice

15                                   JUSTICE BARRETT:  No questions.
16                                   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you,

19                                   ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. ELIZABETH B. PRELOGAR
20                                   ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
21                                   GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Mr. Chief Justice,
22                                   and may it please the Court:
23                                   COVID-19 is the deadliest pandemic in
24                                   American history and it poses a particularly
25                                   acute workplace danger.  Workers are getting

1                                    sick and dying every day because of their
2                                    exposure to the virus at work.
3                                    OSHA amassed substantial evidence of
4                                    wide-sprayed -- widespread workplace outbreaks
5                                    across all industries.  It studied the science
6                                    of how this virus is transmitted and found that
7                                    workers are exposed to danger when they're
8                                    inside together for as little as 15 minutes,
9                                    and OSHA considered the extensive evidence that
10                                   unvaccinated employees are at heightened risk
11                                   of contracting the virus, of transmitting it to
12                                   others and infecting their coworkers, and of
13                                   suffering the gravest consequences,
14                                   hospitalization and even death.
15                                   To protect against that grave danger,
16                                   the standard requires employers to adopt a
17                                   policy that unvaccinated employees either get
18                                   vaccinated or mask and test.  Those are
19                                   commonplace and highly effective measures that
20                                   OSHA determined were essential to stopping the
21                                   spread of this dangerous disease at work.
22                                   The Applicants try to portray this
23                                   standard as unprecedented.  But this lies in
24                                   the heartland of OSHA's regulatory authority.
25                                   Congress charged the agency with setting

1                                    nationwide standards to protect the health and
2                                    safety of employees throughout the nation, and
3                                    Congress specifically appropriated money to
4                                    OSHA to address COVID-19 in the workplace.
5                                    Nothing in the statute or the agency's
6                                    regulatory history bars the use of these
7                                    measures.  Just the opposite.
8                                    Section 669(a)(5) of the OSH Act specifically
9                                    contemplates that immunization requirements can
10                                   be imposed under the Act, and OSHA has
11                                   previously protected workers with measures like
12                                   masking, testing, and encouraging vaccination.
13                                   OSHA had statutory authority to rely
14                                   on those measures here, which it found would
15                                   save 6,500 lives and prevent 250,000
16                                   hospitalizations in just six months.
17                                   As the preamble to the standard
18                                   explains, exposure to COVID-19 on the job is
19                                   the biggest threat to workers in OSHA's
20                                   history.
21                                   The Court should reject the argument
22                                   that the agency is powerless to address that
23                                   grave danger.  I welcome the Court's questions.
24                                   JUSTICE THOMAS:  General, the --

1                                    at?  Is it the employer not providing -- making
2                                    sure that employees are vaccinated or masked,
3                                    or is it the employees who decline to be
4                                    vaccinated or masked?
5                                    GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Well, it's the
6                                    grave danger to exposure to COVID-19 --
7                                    JUSTICE THOMAS:  But who's --
8                                    GENERAL PRELOGAR:                                 -- at work, Justice
9                                    Thomas.
10                                   JUSTICE THOMAS:                                   -- who -- who is
11                                   trying -- who refuses to do that?
12                                   GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Ultimately, what
13                                   the agency is doing with these standards is
14                                   requiring that either through a vaccination
15                                   requirement or through a masking-and-testing
16                                   policy that unvaccinated workers who stand the
17                                   highest chance of contracting the virus at
18                                   work, of infecting others at work, and then,
19                                   ultimately, if they get -- if they catch COVID
20                                   at work, of then suffering death possibly or
21                                   even hospitalization are protected in all of
22                                   those circumstances.
23                                   So I think what this standard does is
24                                   it regulates employers by requiring them to
25                                   adopt a policy that will directly target that

1                                    grave danger.
2                                    JUSTICE THOMAS:  I -- I understand
3                                    that.  But who is declining to do that?  Is it
4                                    the employer or the employee?
5                                    GENERAL PRELOGAR:  I think it can be
6                                    both.  There are many employers around the
7                                    country that have voluntarily imposed these
8                                    kinds of requirements with their workers in
9                                    recognition that vaccination is the single most
10                                   effective way to protect workers in the
11                                   workplace or that have used masking and testing
12                                   requirements to the same end, so many employers
13                                   are doing it, but part of OSHA's function and
14                                   what Congress charged the agency with doing is
15                                   to look at those kinds of best practices and
16                                   impose them through standards to ensure that
17                                   workers, no matter what specific controls their
18                                   employers have in place, are maximally
19                                   protected.
20                                   JUSTICE THOMAS:  One last question.
21                                   You make -- I think you put quite a bit of
22                                   weight on the acute crisis that we're in.  But
23                                   do you -- would your argument also be -- would
24                                   your argument be the same for any infectious
25                                   disease that is taken into the workplace?

1                                    GENERAL PRELOGAR:  No.  I think that
2                                    with respect to other infectious diseases it
3                                    would be necessary for OSHA to develop the
4                                    record to demonstrate that the requisite risk
5                                    level that the statute requires --
6                                    JUSTICE THOMAS:  But you could --
7                                    GENERAL PRELOGAR:                                 -- is satisfied.
8                                    JUSTICE THOMAS:                                   -- it's not that you
9                                    would do it, but could you do it?
10                                   GENERAL PRELOGAR:  If there were, in
11                                   fact, a grave danger to employees posed by
12                                   another infectious disease, then, yes, we think
13                                   that Congress clearly contemplated that OSHA is

15                                   responsibility to protect workers.
16                                   JUSTICE THOMAS:  Have you -- has OSHA
17                                   ever done that?
18                                   GENERAL PRELOGAR:  OSHA has enacted
19                                   any number of standards --
20                                   JUSTICE THOMAS:  Example?
21                                   GENERAL PRELOGAR:                                 -- that address
22                                   those kinds of threats.  For example, the
23                                   blood-borne pathogen standard that we have
24                                   pointed to before was intended to protect
25                                   employees from the risk of viruses that they

1                                    can contract through blood-borne transmission.
2                                    So it's not --
3                                    JUSTICE THOMAS:  Is that in -- is that
4                                    in the general workplace or just in healthcare
5                                    sectors?
6                                    GENERAL PRELOGAR:  That standard
7                                    applied anywhere where employees can
8                                    predictably encounter blood-borne pathogens.
9                                    So it wasn't just the healthcare context.  It
10                                   can apply to flight attendants.  It can apply
11                                   to janitors.  It was a standard that directly
12                                   targeted the exposure wherever it exists, just
13                                   like this one does.
14                                   JUSTICE THOMAS:  Thank you.
15                                   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  General, you
16                                   said just a short while ago that this presented
17                                   -- COVID presented a grave danger to people in
18                                   the workplace.  In a few minutes, we'll hear an
19                                   argument in the CMS case, and it will be that
20                                   it presents a grave danger in Medicare and
21                                   Medicaid facilities.
22                                   Not here, but in the lower courts, the
23                                   federal contractor mandate, the argument is
24                                   going to be it's a grave danger to federal
25                                   contractors.

1                                    Could you give me examples of some
2                                    federal agencies where you would be willing to
3                                    say COVID is not a grave danger in their -- in
4                                    that context?
5                                    GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Well, Mr. Chief
6                                    Justice, I haven't, of course, surveyed the
7                                    landscape of all of the different authorities
8                                    that federal agencies can invoke.  I -- I take
9                                    the point of the question --
10                                   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but you
11                                   represent them on a regular basis here, so you
12                                   have a pretty general idea of some other
13                                   examples of federal agencies.
14                                   And my point obviously is that I don't
15                                   think, as more and more mandates, more and more
16                                   agencies come into place, it's a little hard to
17                                   accept the idea that this is particularized to
18                                   this thing, that it's an OSHA regulation, that
19                                   it's a CMS regulation, that it's a federal
20                                   contractor regulation.
21                                   It seems to me that it's that the
22                                   government is trying to work across the
23                                   waterfront and it's just going agency by
24                                   agency.  I mean, this has been referred to, the
25                                   approach, as a work-around, and I'm wondering

1                                    what it is you're trying to work around.
2                                    GENERAL PRELOGAR:  What we're trying
3                                    to do here and what OSHA did was rely on its
4                                    express statutory authority to provide -- to
5                                    provide protection to America's workforce from
6                                    grave dangers like this one.
7                                    So I take the point and don't dispute
8                                    that COVID-19 is a danger in many contexts and
9                                    falls within the jurisdiction of other agencies
10                                   as well, but I think to suggest that because
11                                   this disease is so prevalent, because it
12                                   presents such a widespread harm, somehow OSHA
13                                   has less power to do anything about it with
14                                   respect to the --
15                                   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, it's not
16                                   so much that OSHA has less power.  It's that
17                                   the idea that this is specific to particular
18                                   agencies really doesn't hold much water when
19                                   you're picking them off one by -- one by one.
20                                   I think maybe it should be analyzed
21                                   more broadly as this is, in effect, an effort
22                                   to cover the waterfront.  I'm not saying it's a
23                                   bad thing.
24                                   But I don't know that we should try to
25                                   find, okay, what specific thing can we find to

1                                    say, oh, this is covered by OSHA?  What
2                                    specific thing can we find to say that this is
3                                    covered by the hospitals?  What specific thing
4                                    can we find to say, oh, no, we're doing this
5                                    because this is a federal contractor?
6                                    It seems to me that the more and more
7                                    mandates that pop up in different agencies,
8                                    it's fair -- I wonder if it's not fair for us
9                                    to look at the Court as a general exercise of
10                                   power by the federal government and then ask
11                                   the questions of, well, why doesn't Congress
12                                   have a say in this, and why don't the -- why
13                                   doesn't this be the primary responsibility of
14                                   the states?
15                                   GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Congress absolutely
16                                   has a say in this, and it spoke here.  It
17                                   passed the OSH Act and -- and promulgated
18                                   Section 655(c) specifically to empower OSHA to
19                                   take action to protect workers from grave
20                                   dangers from physically --
21                                   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  When did it --
22                                   when did it do that?
23                                   GENERAL PRELOGAR:  The OSH Act was
24                                   enacted in 1970, I believe.  And the agency, as

2                                    this constitutes a grave danger in the
3                                    workplace.
4                                    CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I don't
5                                    think you can say that that specifically
6                                    addressed it -- addressed to this problem.
7                                    GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Well, Mr. Chief
8                                    Justice, the Court obviously has a statute in
9                                    front of it that it needs to examine.  I think
10                                   that there is no doubt that COVID-19
11                                   constitutes a physically hazardous agent within
12                                   the meaning of this provision.  I think that
13                                   the immediacy and magnitude of harm here
14                                   clearly constitutes a grave danger.
15                                   Unvaccinated workers stand a 1-in-14 chance of
16                                   being hospitalized, a 1-in-200 chance of dying.
17                                   The country hasn't --
18                                   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It sounds like
19                                   the sort of thing --
20                                   GENERAL PRELOGAR:                                 -- seen numbers
21                                   like that --
22                                   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                            -- it sounds
23                                   like the sort of thing that states will be
24                                   responding to or should be or -- and that

1                                    rather than agency by agency, the federal
2                                    government, the executive branch, acting alone,
3                                    is responding to it.  And we're supposed to
4                                    say, well, yes, this is a CMS problem; yes,
5                                    this is an OSHA problem; yes, this is a federal
6                                    contractor problem.  The military is on its
7                                    own; they take orders.
8                                    But, again, I guess I'm just repeating
9                                    myself.  It seems to me that we should be
10                                   looking at it as an across-the-board issue, as
11                                   opposed to let's see what OSHA looks like,

21                                   interpretation and looking at agencies'

23                                   the text that Congress enacted for purposes of

2                                    empowered to act to present -- to protect
3                                    America against what is -- what is happening in
4                                    this country right now shouldn't diminish the
5                                    force of the express statutory
6                                    authorization here.
7                                    JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah, but I think the
8                                    question is this.  I mean, it is a rather deep
9                                    -- in a sense, a deep question.  Can you -- or
10                                   maybe you did.  Could the White House, say,
11                                   issue an order to all federal employees, and
12                                   what it says is every federal employee in any
13                                   agency who has authority under a statute, which
14                                   means all of them, to require those whom they
15                                   regulate to insist that their employees be
16                                   vaccinated, do it?
17                                   Now they can't legally tell you do it.
18                                   But it's a strong policy.  And that's what's
19                                   happened.  Now I don't know the implications of
20                                   that.  I never thought of that.  But I think
21                                   that's what you're being asked, is that -- is
22                                   that -- and -- and I don't know if you ever
23                                   thought of it.  But, I mean, has that happened?
24                                   GENERAL PRELOGAR:  I think it's
25                                   incorrect to say that that is what is happening

1                                    here.  This policy clearly --
2                                    JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah, but, I mean,
3                                    has that happened generally?  Has that
4                                    happened?  Did somebody issue such an order?
5                                    GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Justice Breyer,
6                                    standing before you today, I'm not sure that I
7                                    can think of a precise historical example of
8                                    that kind of order.
9                                    JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no, I mean in
10                                   this instance.  The answer -- your answer, I
11                                   take it, is no, there is no such order.
12                                   GENERAL PRELOGAR:  That's right.  I
13                                   mean, certainly, I think that -- that
14                                   throughout this nation there is --
15                                   JUSTICE BREYER:  I don't want to put
16                                   words in your mouth.  Don't tell me there isn't
17                                   such an order if there is.
18                                   GENERAL PRELOGAR:  No, I'm not aware
19                                   of any such order.
20                                   JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Or
21                                   something like that, okay.  I have one other
22                                   question, which is because I'm operating
23                                   between two things.  One is the -- the merits,
24                                   which might be difficult.  I don't know.  I'm
25                                   not taking a view on that, but at least they're

1                                    difficult and could take time.
2                                    And the other is the question of a
3                                    stay.  Now, on the question of a stay, I read
4                                    from research that we've done, but I don't know
5                                    if it's right, that the argument was -- what
6                                    about the argument that they've made?  One is
7                                    that, well, if we issue a stay today, tomorrow
8                                    more people will stay home and things will get
9                                    worse.  See?  That was one of their arguments.
10                                   And the other argument -- well, all
11                                   right, what about that?  That seemed to me to
12                                   be the main one.
13                                   GENERAL PRELOGAR:  As I understand the
14                                   argument, they're concerned about worker
15                                   attrition with respect to that -- that
16                                   particular claim.
17                                   JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah.
18                                   GENERAL PRELOGAR:  And the agency gave
19                                   sustained attention to this very issue.  It
20                                   spanned several pages of the Federal Register.
21                                   The agency looked at surveys that attempt to
22                                   analyze how workers will respond and looked at
23                                   the real, on-the-ground practical experience of
24                                   companies that had imposed these kinds of
25                                   mandates and found that there was substantial

1                                    compliance levels and that the concern that
2                                    workers would leave in droves was -- was
3                                    misplaced.
4                                    And then the agency further emphasized
5                                    they had provided flexibility to employers to
6                                    adopt a mask-and-test policy instead of a
7                                    vaccination requirement specifically because
8                                    the employers are best positioned to understand
9                                    --
10                                   JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.
11                                   GENERAL PRELOGAR:                                 -- their workforce
12                                   and to know which of these options is going to
13                                   ensure maximum compliance.
14                                   JUSTICE ALITO:  On this --
15                                   JUSTICE BREYER:  What about on the
16                                   merits?  I just have one other, which is on the
17                                   merits.  You've heard and you've read the
18                                   argument on the other side that, look, what
19                                   OSHA could easily have done or should have done
20                                   is go through industry by industry or groups of
21                                   industries by groups of industries and -- and
22                                   say there's this here and there's that there.
23                                   Instead, what they did is everybody over a
24                                   hundred employees, except for, and then they
25                                   had a few exceptions, working alone, working at

1                                    home, a religious exemption, you can prove to
2                                    us that you have some other thing that's just
3                                    as good.  You know, they went that way, across
4                                    industries instead of one by the other.  That's
5                                    one of their arguments.
6                                    What would you say to that?
7                                    GENERAL PRELOGAR:  My response to that
8                                    is that the Secretary here cited overwhelming
9                                    scientific and medical evidence that the grave
10                                   danger exists based on how this virus is
11                                   transmitted anywhere people gather indoors
12                                   together.
13                                   And that applies to a lot of
14                                   workplaces, but that just turns on the nature
15                                   of how this virus is communicable between
16                                   people.  As -- as Justice Kagan noted, often
17                                   employees have little control over their work
18                                   environments.  They can't control whether they
19                                   can socially distance, who they come into
20                                   contact with, what precautions those people are
21                                   taking, what ventilation systems exist.  And,
22                                   ultimately, OSHA determined that anywhere there
23                                   is a risk of indoor transmission, there is a
24                                   grave danger to unvaccinated employees.
25                                   Now I take the point, as the Chief

1                                    Justice's hypothetical focused on -- I think
2                                    Justice Barrett focused on this as well -- that
3                                    there are certain workplaces -- factories,
4                                    assembly lines -- where the risk is even
5                                    graver, where the danger and the -- the chance
6                                    of transmission is heightened.  But I don't
7                                    think that that in any sense calls into
8                                    question the Secretary's determination that
9                                    there is a baseline grave danger in any
10                                   worksite where that inside risk of transmission
11                                   can occur.
12                                   JUSTICE ALITO:  Can I ask you a
13                                   question --
14                                   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  General, can we --
15                                   I'm sorry.
16                                   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Alito.
17                                   JUSTICE ALITO:  I just wanted to ask
18                                   you a question on this issue of the
19                                   commencement of enforcement and the issuance of
20                                   a stay.
21                                   This ETS was issued a couple of months
22                                   ago, isn't that right?
23                                   GENERAL PRELOGAR:  On November 5.
24                                   That's correct.
25                                   JUSTICE ALITO:  Yeah, on November 5.

1                                    All right.  And it hasn't been enforced during
2                                    that period.  These cases arrived at this Court
3                                    just a short time ago.  They present lots of
4                                    difficult, complicated issues.  We have
5                                    hundreds of pages of briefing.  We're receiving
6                                    very helpful arguments this morning.
7                                    Does the federal government object to
8                                    our taking a couple of days maybe to think
9                                    about this, to digest the arguments before
10                                   people start losing jobs?
11                                   GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Well, Justice
12                                   Alito, if you're asking whether it would be
13                                   appropriate for the Court to issue a brief
14                                   administrative stay, certainly, we think that
15                                   that would be within the Court's prerogative if
16                                   it -- if it thinks that it's necessary to do
17                                   that.
18                                   Ultimately, for the injunction that
19                                   they're actually asking for here, the
20                                   Applicants would have to show an indisputably
21                                   clear right to relief, which we think they
22                                   can't satisfy.
23                                   JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I -- no, I'm
24                                   asking about an administrative stay.  I won't
25                                   get into an argument about indisputably clear.

1                                    But your argument -- your point is you think it
2                                    would be appropriate or would not be
3                                    appropriate if we issued a short administrative
4                                    stay?  Or if we do that, are you going to say,
5                                    well, they're causing people to die every day?
6                                    GENERAL PRELOGAR:  We do think that
7                                    the agency found that there is grave harm every
8                                    day, and the numbers are stark, thousands of
9                                    lives --
10                                   JUSTICE ALITO:  But there was that
11                                   grave harm during every single day --
12                                   GENERAL PRELOGAR:                                 -- hundreds of
13                                   thousands of hospitalizations over six months.
14                                   JUSTICE ALITO:                                    -- but was there not
15                                   that same grave harm during every single day
16                                   between the time when this was issued and --
17                                   and today?
18                                   GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Well, certainly, we
19                                   think that the harm has existed and been
20                                   present throughout, and the agency specifically
21                                   set aggressive compliance deadlines to --
22                                   JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, my answer -- I
23                                   asked a really simple question.  And you have
24                                   the prerogative to say, no, we think, you know,
25                                   horrible consequences are going to -- are going

1                                    to ensue if you issue even an administrative
2                                    stay of a short period of time, and we don't
3                                    think that you need to have that time to digest
4                                    this case and decide it.
5                                    GENERAL PRELOGAR:  I'm not going to
6                                    say that, Justice Alito.  If the Court believes
7                                    that it needs a brief administrative stay,
8                                    then, of course, it can enter it.
9                                    JUSTICE KAGAN:  But you mean "brief,"
10                                   don't you?
11                                   GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yes.  We think that
12                                   there are lives being lost every day.
13                                   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, brief
14                                   compared --
15                                   JUSTICE BREYER:  I thought 750 --
16                                   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry.
17                                   Brief compared to what?  The months that it --
18                                   excuse me -- the months that it hasn't been in
19                                   effect since November, whatever it is, when the
20                                   courts have been active in this area, or
21                                   brief -- brief compared to what?
22                                   GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Well, Mr. Chief
23                                   Justice, I think that the agency well explained
24                                   that the employers who are covered by this
25                                   needed time to come into compliance.  The

1                                    agency announced that it was exercising
2                                    enforcement discretion because of the confusion
3                                    that had been created by the Fifth Circuit
4                                    stay.
5                                    Maybe it would be helpful for me to
6                                    explain exactly what the January 10 deadline
7                                    means with respect to compliance.  The agency
8                                    has announced that for employers who are acting
9                                    in good faith, it is not going to enforce any
10                                   of the provisions of this ETS until January 10.
11                                   And what that means as a practical matter is
12                                   that employers need to be adopting their
13                                   policies, they need to be ascertaining the
14                                   vaccination status of their employees, and as
15                                   of January 10, they need to be requiring
16                                   masking for any employees who remain
17                                   unvaccinated.
18                                   So it's not as though immediately
19                                   employee -- employees are going to be quitting
20                                   their jobs or leaving in response with the
21                                   worst predictions.  On January 10, if this
22                                   standard remains in effect, then masking will
23                                   immediately be required, and the testing will
24                                   kick in on February 9.
25                                   JUSTICE BREYER:  So if we delay that

1                                    one day, maybe I'm wrong, and please tell me if
2                                    I am, but the numbers I read is when they
3                                    issued this order, there were approximately
4                                    70-something thousand new cases every day.  And
5                                    yesterday there were close to 750,000.
6                                    So if we delay it a day, and if it
7                                    were to have effect, then 750,000 more people
8                                    will have COVID who otherwise, if we didn't
9                                    delay it, wouldn't have?  I mean, I -- I don't
10                                   doubt the power of the Court to issue a stay.
11                                   I'm just saying what are the consequences of
12                                   that?
13                                   And if I'm wrong, you better tell me
14                                   I'm wrong because I -- I thought that it really
15                                   did make a difference to people who might get
16                                   -- you have the numbers.  I saw the numbers.
17                                   Well, all right, what -- so what --
18                                   what do you say?  Now you say does not --
19                                   that's really not a problem?
20                                   GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Justice Breyer, we
21                                   -- we absolutely agree that this pandemic has
22                                   been dynamic, that it is constantly evolving
23                                   and that the current conditions are -- are
24                                   posing a truly grave danger.

1                                    understand from your previous answer that
2                                    enforcement qua testing doesn't occur until
3                                    February 9th, correct?
4                                    GENERAL PRELOGAR:  That's correct,
5                                    Justice Sotomayor.
6                                    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The only thing
7                                    that would happen in the next few days or -- up
8                                    to now, everybody should have a plan in place,
9                                    correct?
10                                   GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Correct.
11                                   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There's no -- been
12                                   no stay.  So starting tomorrow, the only thing
13                                   that are required are masks, correct?
14                                   GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Masking for
15                                   unvaccinated workers, that's correct.
16                                   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's the only
17                                   thing that occurs.  And so until February 9th
18                                   when the testing comes into effect, that's when
19                                   the threat of -- of resignations or expense
20                                   comes into effect, correct?
21                                   GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yes, as I
22                                   understand the -- what the applicants are

1                                    aspect.
2                                    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So the need for an
3                                    administrative stay, if we're talking about a
4                                    few days, is really small, if -- very small,
5                                    correct?
6                                    GENERAL PRELOGAR:  I certainly myself
7                                    do not think an administrative stay would be
8                                    warranted here, but I of course defer to the
9                                    Court on that.
10                                   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right, one
11                                   other question if I might --

13                                   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                              -- counsel.
14                                   I want to go back to the chief's
15                                   question and to Justice Thomas's question
16                                   and -- and in part, to Neil -- to Justice
17                                   Gorsuch's questions earlier, the issue of who
18                                   should act and who can act.
19                                   An agency takes a while to act and
20                                   this is -- and it's acting under an emergency
21                                   order or an emergency statutory delegation by
22                                   Congress.  And the chief says Congress should
23                                   act; we shouldn't let every agency act.
24                                   Could you speak about the relative,
25                                   both expertise and speed with which Congress

1                                    can act in -- to survey the countless work
2                                    sites in our economy to identify the health and
3                                    safety hazards in each one and to legislate
4                                    with the granular specificity necessary,
5                                    necessary to address the hazards in all of
6                                    these different workplaces?
7                                    I understood the fact that in an
8                                    emergency we should not violate the
9                                    Constitution, but I'm not quite sure what
10                                   regulation of safe and healthy, what provision
11                                   of the Constitution it violates.
12                                   But I want you to get to the -- to --
13                                   to the general question that some of thigh
14                                   colleagues have raised.  Who's in a better
15                                   position to act and why and why is it in a
16                                   better position to act constitutionally?
17                                   GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yes, of course,
18                                   Justice Sotomayor.
19                                   To be clear, we think that Congress
20                                   has already acted here in passing
21                                   Section 655(c) to authorize OSHA to take this
22                                   kind of specific action in response to an
23                                   emergency situation.
24                                   If you look at the plain text of the
25                                   statute, we think that OSHA's standard clearly

1                                    falls within the terms that Congress enacted.
2                                    COVID 19 is a great danger, it's a physically
3                                    harmful agent, and the agency found that these
4                                    measures are essential to protect workers.
5                                    So we think the statutory language
6                                    already exists.  And to the extent that the
7                                    applicants are suggesting that there's some
8                                    kind of specific authorization requirement here
9                                    that Congress had to do more, I think that gets
10                                   to the heart of your question, which is that
11                                   when this Court has interpreted statutes
12                                   before, it hasn't departed from plain meaning
13                                   and imposed that kind of burden on Congress to
14                                   legislate with that specificity and that
15                                   granularity, particularly in an emergency
16                                   situation like this one.
17                                   And the applicants have pointed to no
18                                   aspect of the statute that would warrant that
19                                   kind of result here.  It's their interpretation
20                                   that runs counter to express statutory
21                                   provisions, Section 669(a)(5), that
22                                   specifically contemplates that immunization
23                                   requirements can be imposed, the American
24                                   Recovery Plan Act, that, where Congress
25                                   specifically appropriated $100 million to OSHA

2                                    legislation to carry out COVID-19 related
3                                    worker protection activities.
4                                    CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well,
5                                    you're -- you're saying that Congress acted.
6                                    Don't -- don't complain that Congress hasn't
7                                    done anything and that -- you know, that was 50
8                                    years ago that you're saying Congress acted.
9                                    I don't think you had COVID in mind.
10                                   That was almost closer to the Spanish Flu than
11                                   it is to today's problem.
12                                   Now, I understand the idea that
13                                   agencies are more expert than Congress.  And I
14                                   understand the idea that they can move more
15                                   quickly than Congress.
16                                   But this is something that the federal
17                                   government has never done before, right,
18                                   mandated vaccine coverage?
19                                   GENERAL PRELOGAR:  It's true that
20                                   there has been no standard that looks exactly
21                                   like this one.  The federal government has
22                                   encouraged vaccination as this standard does
23                                   and other provisions like the blood borne
24                                   pathogen standard.  And masking and medical
25                                   testing of employees are common features of

2                                    CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, is --
3                                    is -- is it that important consideration that
4                                    we should take into effect, for example, along
5                                    with the fact that the police power to take
6                                    such action is more commonly exercised by the
7                                    states, and we've had many cases coming out of
8                                    the states and municipalities that -- that --
9                                    that -- that evidence that.
10                                   And also that it's -- yes, 50 years
11                                   ago Congress passed a general provision, but I
12                                   think it's certainly hard to argue, and you're
13                                   doing a good job of it, that that gives free
14                                   reign to the agencies to take -- I guess this
15                                   is invoking the major cases doctrine, that it
16                                   gives free reign to the agencies to enact such
17                                   broad regulation that is -- was certainly
18                                   unfamiliar to Congress in 1970.
19                                   GENERAL PRELOGAR:  There are a lot of
20                                   elements to that question.  I'd like to try to
21                                   take them in turn.
22                                   I -- I -- I think that Congress did
23                                   specifically contemplate that there would be
24                                   emergency situations that posed grave dangers
25                                   to workers throughout America, and it

1                                    specifically empowered OSHA to take action in
2                                    response to that.
3                                    I understand the -- the suggestion
4                                    here that the standard is unprecedented but I
5                                    don't think it would withstand scrutiny.  If
6                                    you look at the various claims that the
7                                    applicants are making, they -- they first
8                                    object to the scope of the standard, the number
9                                    of employers who are covered but OSHA commonly
10                                   issues nationwide standards that govern all
11                                   employers throughout the nation with respect to
12                                   risks that exist throughout the nation.  And
13                                   that describes COVID-19.
14                                   There is substantial evidence here to
15                                   justify the scope of the standard.
16                                   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank -- go
17                                   ahead.
18                                   GENERAL PRELOGAR:  And just to -- to
19                                   close the loop with one final response, which
20                                   is to focus on the particular mitigation
21                                   measures.  There, too, we think that there is
22                                   no indication that Congress couldn't have
23                                   anticipated or intended OSHA to use these types
24                                   of measures to combat a deadly virus at work.

2                                    single most effective way to target the spread
3                                    of a deadly virus and to think that Congress
4                                    would have meant to preclude OSHA from
5                                    encouraging vaccination, I think, is
6                                    inconsistent, both with the text of the statute
7                                    and with the broader history of immunization
8                                    requirements in this country, which have
9                                    commonly been imposed.
10                                   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you,
11                                   counsel.
12                                   Justice Thomas, anything further?
13                                   JUSTICE THOMAS:  Just, I'm -- I'm
14                                   curious.  This probably doesn't go to the
15                                   dispositions matter, but is a vaccine the only
16                                   way to treat COVID?
17                                   GENERAL PRELOGAR:  It is certainly the
18                                   single most effective way to target all of the
19                                   hazards OSHA identified, both the -- the
20                                   chances of contracting the virus in the first
21                                   place, the risk of infecting other workers on
22                                   the work cite, and with respect to the negative
23                                   health consequences, that vaccination provides
24                                   protection on all of those fronts.

6                                    into a mouse hole and the question of whether

9                                    to see if it might be fundamentally different

15                                   on the job.  And this affects employees all the
16                                   time.  If you're vaccinated while you're on the
17                                   job, you're vaccinated when you're not on the
18                                   job.
19                                   Isn't this different from anything
20                                   OSHA has done before in that respect?
21                                   GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So two responses to
22                                   that.  First, of course there's also a
23                                   mask-and-test option here, so I think even --
24                                   JUSTICE ALITO:  Okay --
25                                   GENERAL PRELOGAR:                                 -- on that --

1                                    JUSTICE ALITO:                                    -- well, right now --
2                                    GENERAL PRELOGAR:                                 -- analysis --
3                                    JUSTICE ALITO:                                    -- I'm talking just
4                                    about the vaccine.
5                                    GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So focusing just on
6                                    vaccination, I think that that's a way to
7                                    describe it, that it provides protection when
8                                    you're not at work.
9                                    But OSHA was directly targeting and --
10                                   and trying to provide the protection at work
11                                   and I don't think there's any basis in the text
12                                   of the statute to think this kind of --
13                                   JUSTICE ALITO:  All right.  Suppose
14                                   that --
15                                   GENERAL PRELOGAR:                                 -- protection is
16                                   off limits.
17                                   JUSTICE ALITO:  I mean, suppose, this
18                                   is a little science fiction, but maybe it will
19                                   illustrate a point.
20                                   Suppose that this protection were
21                                   provided not by the administration of a vaccine
22                                   but by waving a wand over employees when they
23                                   arrive at work and suppose that wand also had
24                                   the capability of taking away this protection
25                                   when the employee leaves work.

1                                    Would OSHA have the authority to tell
2                                    employees you must -- we will -- we are going
3                                    to wave -- you must have this wand waved over
4                                    you when you arrive, but you can't have it
5                                    taken off when you leave?
6                                    GENERAL PRELOGAR:  No, I don't think
7                                    that OSHA would have that authority.
8                                    JUSTICE ALITO:  All right.  So it's
9                                    different in that respect.  And here's another
10                                   respect in which it may be different.  And I
11                                   don't want to be misunderstood in making this
12                                   point because I'm not saying the vaccines are
13                                   unsafe.  The FDA has approved them.  It's found
14                                   that they're safe.  It says that the benefits
15                                   greatly outweigh the risks.  I'm not contesting
16                                   that in any way.  I don't want to be
17                                   misunderstood.  I'm sure I will be
18                                   misunderstood.  I just want to emphasize I'm
19                                   not making that point.
20                                   But is it not the case that this --
21                                   these vaccines and every other vaccine of which
22                                   I'm aware and many other medications have
23                                   benefits and they also have risks and that some
24                                   people who are vaccinated and some people who
25                                   take medication that is highly beneficial will

2                                    of these vaccines?  And if that is -- is that
3                                    true?
4                                    GENERAL PRELOGAR:  That can be true,
5                                    but, of course, there is far, far greater risk
6                                    from being --

10                                   --

12                                   magnitude.
13                                   JUSTICE ALITO:  Right.  There is some
14                                   risk, do you dispute that?
15                                   GENERAL PRELOGAR:  There can be a
16                                   minimal risk with respect to some individuals,
17                                   but -- but again I would emphasize that I think
18                                   that there -- there would be no basis to think
19                                   that these FDA-approved and authorized vaccines
20                                   are not safe and effective.
21                                   JUSTICE ALITO:  No, I'm --

3                                    There is a risk, right?  Has any other
4                                    -- has OSHA ever imposed any other safety
5                                    regulation that imposes some extra risk, some
6                                    different risk, on the employee, so that if you
7                                    have to wear a hard hat on the job, wearing a

10                                   this?
11                                   GENERAL PRELOGAR:  I can't think of
12                                   anything else that's precisely like this, but I
13                                   think to suggest that OSHA is precluded from
14                                   using the most common, routine, safe,
15                                   effective, proven strategy to fight an
16                                   infectious disease at work would be a departure
17                                   from how this statute should be understood.
18                                   JUSTICE KAGAN:  Can I just say,
19                                   General, that regulators think of risk/risk
20                                   tradeoffs constantly when they make
21                                   regulations, that there are constant situations
22                                   in which there are risk/risk tradeoffs, risks
23                                   on both sides, but one risk vastly outweighs
24                                   another risk, and that that comes up throughout
25                                   regulatory space.

12                                   JUSTICE ALITO:  All of whom have --
13                                   GENERAL PRELOGAR:                                -- who might be
14                                   older --
15                                   JUSTICE ALITO:                                   -- all of -- all --
16                                   GENERAL PRELOGAR:                                -- might have other
17                                   comorbidities --
18                                   JUSTICE ALITO:                                   -- all of whom have
19                                   balanced the risk differently, maybe very
20                                   foolishly, but they want to balance the risks
21                                   presented to their health in a different way.
22                                   And OSHA says, no, you can't do that, and that
23                                   applies when you're on the job and also when
24                                   you're not on the job and for the rest of your
25                                   life because you have to take these vaccines,

1                                    unless the testing option is viable.
2                                    GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Well, one small
3                                    factual correction, if I could, and then a
4                                    broader legal point, I think it's wrong to say
5                                    that everyone who's unvaccinated is just
6                                    assuming the risk.  Some people can't get
7                                    vaccinations for medical reasons.  Some people
8                                    have deeply held religious beliefs and are
9                                    entitled to religious exemptions.  And OSHA is
10                                   entitled to try to protect those unvaccinated
11                                   workers, no matter the reason they're
12                                   unvaccinated.
13                                   Just on the broader legal point, the
14                                   idea that OSHA is powerless to act to protect
15                                   workers if they simply want to assume the risk
16                                   is inconsistent with how the OSH Act has been
17                                   understood throughout its history.  OSHA
18                                   frequently requires employers to require that
19                                   the employees use protective gear --
20                                   JUSTICE ALITO:  Isn't -- isn't it --
21                                   GENERAL PRELOGAR:                                 -- or take
22                                   precautions if it's not --
23                                   JUSTICE ALITO:  Isn't it the case
24                                   that, most of the time, there's this strong
25                                   reason for saying that it isn't a defense to an

1                                    OSH Act charge, that the employers assumed the
2                                    risk voluntarily, that under most
3                                    circumstances, employers have an incentive to
4                                    avoid compliance with, to avoid the cost and
5                                    inconvenience of the regulation, and so we
6                                    don't want to have -- put the employees under
7                                    pressure, overt or implied, to -- to waive
8                                    protection of a -- a regulation, a protective
9                                    regulation?
10                                   But there's no such incentive here.
11                                   They're free.  The vaccines are free.  And to
12                                   the extent they keep workers healthy and on the
13                                   job, it's in the interests of the employers to
14                                   have them vaccinated.
15                                   GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Well, certainly,
16                                   the -- the fact that workers in the past have
17                                   not wanted to use certain protections has not
18                                   provided a defense to regulations that have
19                                   been issued under the OSH Act.
20                                   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, if I
21                                   might just go back to Justice Alito's question,
22                                   there's no vaccine mandate here, correct?
23                                   GENERAL PRELOGAR:  That's correct.
24                                   And that's what I started with, that, of

1                                    mask-and-test option instead.
2                                    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So, really, the
3                                    question is between masking and testing and/or
4                                    vaccine, but no employer is being put at risk
5                                    greater than they choose to undertake
6                                    themselves, correct?
7                                    GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yes, the -- the
8                                    employers have a choice to adopt either of
9                                    those policies.  And OSHA estimated that
10                                   40 percent of the employers would adopt the
11                                   mask-and-test policy.
12                                   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Number two, with
13                                   respect to the issue of whether a person has
14                                   chosen to run the risk by being unvaccinated,
15                                   you point out that some people can't for a
16                                   variety of different reasons.  But the risk
17                                   here is not just to the person; it's to
18                                   everybody else they put at risk, correct?
19                                   GENERAL PRELOGAR:  That's correct.
20                                   The grave danger finding was premised on
21                                   unvaccinated individuals, but OSHA emphasized
22                                   that ensuring that unvaccinated individuals are
23                                   not spreading the virus in the workplace will
24                                   protect everyone they come into contact with.
25                                   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So they may not be

1                                    a grave danger to other -- other people, but I
2                                    don't see why OSHA has to close its eyes to the
3                                    fact that they place grave risks to
4                                    unvaccinated and substantial risk to other
5                                    people, correct?
6                                    GENERAL PRELOGAR:  That's right, and
7                                    OSHA specifically emphasized that vaccinated
8                                    individuals may still be at significant risk.
9                                    It wasn't ruling out that possibility.  Its
10                                   grave danger finding was focused on all of the
11                                   ways that -- that the unvaccinated contributes
12                                   to the spread of this disease.
13                                   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Thank you,
14                                   counsel.
15                                   JUSTICE ALITO:  Is the testing
16                                   alternative viable at the present time in light
17                                   of the stories that we see about the long lines
18                                   that are required to be tested?
19                                   GENERAL PRELOGAR:  The agency gave
20                                   sustained attention to testing capacity in the
21                                   preamble to the rule.  It looked at existing
22                                   testing capacity and projected out of what
23                                   additional capacity would be necessary for
24                                   employers that choose to adopt the
25                                   mask-and-test policy and concluded there would

1                                    be ample testing in order to comply with the
2                                    rule.
3                                    I'm obviously familiar with the -- the
4                                    news stories you're referencing, and I think
5                                    that the agency could adjust if that proves to
6                                    be a problem, but with respect to reviewing
7                                    this rule, there was certainly a substantial
8                                    basis for the Secretary to conclude that this
9                                    is a viable option.
10                                   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Kagan.
11                                   JUSTICE KAGAN:  I'd like to ask the --
12                                   the -- the government's views of the
13                                   major-questions doctrine that a number of my
14                                   colleagues have asked about.
15                                   And as I -- I see it, there are sort
16                                   of two ways that such a doctrine could operate.
17                                   One is with respect to ambiguous statutes,
18                                   ambiguous either because they're vague or
19                                   because they're statutes that seem to have
20                                   conflicting provisions, you know, where they
21                                   point both ways, and then the major questions
22                                   doctrine is an aid to interpretation of that
23                                   statute, essentially a kind of clue about how
24                                   you should interpret a very
25                                   difficult-to-understand statute.

1                                    And the second way is there's really
2                                    nothing difficult to understand about this.
3                                    The agency action falls within the scope of the
4                                    statutory authority.  There's just no question
5                                    that it does.  And yet, because the agency
6                                    action is a kind of a big deal, we're just
7                                    going to ignore the fact that it falls clearly
8                                    within the scope of the delegated authority and
9                                    say that, notwithstanding that that's true,
10                                   Congress has to re-up it.
11                                   So I think I'd like you to talk about
12                                   those two versions of the major questions
13                                   doctrine with respect to this rule.  You know,
14                                   does -- what do you think of those two
15                                   versions, and which of the versions potentially
16                                   applies here?
17                                   GENERAL PRELOGAR:  I think that
18                                   perfectly encapsulates the two versions.  And
19                                   we think that this Court's precedents clearly
20                                   demonstrate that it's the first version that
21                                   you articulated is the way that the Court has
22                                   previously considered economic and political
23                                   consequences.
24                                   So it's never been the case that the
25                                   Court has started at the outset by saying does

1                                    this seem like a big deal, does this agency
2                                    action have a lot of consequences, and then
3                                    used that as a basis to depart from the plain
4                                    language of the statute or to say Congress has
5                                    to specifically authorize it; we're not going
6                                    to give the statutory text its -- its ordinary
7                                    meaning.
8                                    Instead, in the cases where the Court
9                                    has looked at those kinds of consequences, it
10                                   has always identified a conflict with other
11                                   express statutory language, a conflict with
12                                   other statutes that Congress has enacted that
13                                   directly addressed the issue at question, or a
14                                   conflict with the entire structure of the
15                                   statute such that it would be unrecognizable to
16                                   the Congress that enacted it.
17                                   And it's only been in those situations
18                                   where the Court has identified a textual and
19                                   structural problem with the agency's
20                                   interpretation in the beginning, using those
21                                   traditional tools of statutory construction,
22                                   that the Court has then gone on to say that its
23                                   interpretation of the statute is confirmed by
24                                   the economic and political consequences that
25                                   would ensue.

1                                    So I think it would be a sea change
2                                    for this Court to reverse the order of
3                                    operations as the applicants are asking for
4                                    here, and to start off by asking does this seem
5                                    like it has economic and political
6                                    consequences, and it would ultimately, would
7                                    disservice the principles of the separation of
8                                    powers and to -- to Congress's ability to have
9                                    a clear statutory enactments, even if they're
10                                   broad, given the effect that they have.
11                                   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice
12                                   Gorsuch.
13                                   JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Yes.  So my -- my
14                                   question with respect to the major questions
15                                   doctrine is this:  We accept that it's not our
16                                   role to decide public health questions, but it
17                                   is our important job to decide who should
18                                   decide those questions.
19                                   I think we all agree on that.  And
20                                   here our choice on the one hand is a federal
21                                   agency and on the other hand the Congress of
22                                   the United States and state governments.
23                                   Now, you argue we should not consider
24                                   the major questions doctrine unless and until
25                                   we find a statutory ambiguity.  I understand
Heritage Reporting Corporation

118
1                                    that.  But let's -- let's say the Court does
2                                    find such ambiguity.  I know you will contest
3                                    the premise, but let's just work on it.
4                                    If -- if there is an ambiguity, why
5                                    isn't this a major question that, therefore,
6                                    belongs to the people's representatives of the
7                                    states and in the halls of Congress, given that
8                                    the statute at issue here is, as the Chief
9                                    Justice pointed out, 50 years old, doesn't
10                                   address this question.
11                                   The rule affects, I believe, we're
12                                   told, 80 million people, and the government
13                                   reserves the right to extend it to every
14                                   private business in the country.
15                                   Additionally, states have had the
16                                   responsibility for overseeing vaccination
17                                   mandates.  I rejected a challenge to one just
18                                   the other day from New Mexico.
19                                   Congress had a year to act on the
20                                   question of vaccine mandates already.  As the
21                                   Chief Justice points out, it appears that the
22                                   federal government is going agency-by-agency as
23                                   a work-around to its inability to get Congress
24                                   to act.
25                                   The risks imposed here are not

1                                    unilateral.  There are risks to those who
2                                    choose not to be vaccinated that they're trying
3                                    to avoid sometimes, as you discussed with
4                                    Justice Alito and conceded to him.
5                                    Traditionally OSHA has had rules that
6                                    affect workplace hazards that are unique to the
7                                    workplace and don't involve hazards that affect
8                                    individuals 24 hours a day.
9                                    So that's kind of the general tick
10                                   list we have before us.  And I would just like
11                                   you to address, again, the question, assuming
12                                   the statute's ambiguous, why isn't this a major
13                                   question that normally under our Constitution
14                                   would reserve -- be reserved for the people's
15                                   representatives in the states, in the first
16                                   instance, and the halls of Congress, in the
17                                   second?
18                                   GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So accepting the
19                                   assumption that there is an ambiguity, which of
20                                   course we disagree with, as you know, I think
21                                   that many of the factors you identified are
22                                   just simply inconsistent with the whole premise
23                                   of the OSH Act.
24                                   So it's true that states have a police
25                                   power over health and safety.  But as this

1                                    Court recognized in the Gade case, Congress in
2                                    enacting the OSH Act specifically brought the
3                                    federal government into the role of protecting
4                                    the health and safety of America's workers and
5                                    displacing and preempting state law in that
6                                    field.
7                                    And so I think the idea that simply
8                                    because the states have that residual police
9                                    power provides a basis to assume that the OSH
10                                   Act can't have any application or that there
11                                   has to be a specific authorization here of each
12                                   and every type of mitigation measure is just
13                                   fundamentally inconsistent with Congress's
14                                   policy as embodied in that Act.
15                                   JUSTICE GORSUCH:  What do we make of
16                                   the fact that Congress -- that OSHA has not
17                                   traditionally mandated other vaccines for other
18                                   hazards that could pose a grave -- grave risk,
19                                   some might say.  The flu kills people every
20                                   year.  Other grave diseases do, too.
21                                   And there are vaccines against many.
22                                   And -- and we don't need to list them all.  But
23                                   traditionally OSHA has not regulated in this
24                                   area.
25                                   GENERAL PRELOGAR:  I think that that's

1                                    explained by the fact that COVID-19 is an
2                                    unprecedented pandemic that has a magnitude and
3                                    proportion that --
4                                    JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Well, polio --
5                                    GENERAL PRELOGAR:                                 -- no one has seen
6                                    before.
7                                    JUSTICE GORSUCH:  I mean, people
8                                    forget polio.  That was a pretty bad, you can
9                                    call it a pandemic, you can call it an endemic,
10                                   I don't know what you would call it, but it was
11                                   a terrible scourge on this country for many
12                                   years.
13                                   We have vaccines against that -- that,
14                                   but the federal government through OSHA, so far
15                                   as I know, you can correct me, does not mandate
16                                   every worker in the country to receive such a
17                                   vaccine.  We have flu vaccines.  Flu kills, I
18                                   believe, hundreds of thousands of people every
19                                   year.  OSHA has never purported to regulate on
20                                   that basis.
21                                   What do we make of that when we're
22                                   thinking about what qualifies as a major
23                                   question and what doesn't?
24                                   GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Well, with respect
25                                   to other diseases where there are effective

1                                    vaccinations, I think that the simple
2                                    explanation for why OSHA hasn't had to regulate
3                                    workplace exposure to that is because virtually
4                                    all workers are already vaccinated.
5                                    With respect to many of those
6                                    diseases, all of us have -- at one time or

8                                    vaccination.
9                                    JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Is that true with
10                                   the flu?  Do we know that to be true with the
11                                   flu?
12                                   GENERAL PRELOGAR:  The flu is an
13                                   exception because it's a seasonal illness.  And
14                                   there I think that the explanation for the
15                                   failure to regulate is that it doesn't present
16                                   anything approximating the kind of hazard or
17                                   danger to workers as COVID-19.  I -- I don't
18                                   want to suggest that with the --
19                                   JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Are you suggesting
20                                   that it doesn't pose a grave risk?
21                                   GENERAL PRELOGAR:  I think that the
22                                   agency would have to build the record to
23                                   demonstrate that it would clear that statutory
24                                   hurdle.
25                                   JUSTICE GORSUCH:  But it might?

1                                    GENERAL PRELOGAR:  It would depend on
2                                    the evidence.  Certainly if there were another
3                                    1918 influenza outbreak like the country
4                                    experienced before, yes, absolutely, I think
5                                    OSHA could regulate exposure to influenza in
6                                    the workplace.  That's similar to what's
7                                    happening -- happening with COVID-19 right now.
8                                    CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice

10                                   JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  I want to follow
11                                   up on Justice Gorsuch's and Justice Kagan's
12                                   questions with how the major questions doctrine
13                                   applies and really first zero in on this
14                                   question of ambiguity.
15                                   We've used words like vague, subtle,
16                                   oblique, cryptic, and ambiguous to describe the
17                                   kind of language that would trigger the major
18                                   questions doctrine, if it is a major question.
19                                   We haven't only used the word
20                                   ambiguous.  And it seems to me that a question
21                                   that I would like your help on is applying
22                                   language that is subtle, cryptic, oblique to a
23                                   new context hasn't been done before in the last
24                                   50 years.  How do we think about a question
25                                   like that?  And in answering that, think about

1                                    the benzene case, the Brown & Williamson case
2                                    with tobacco, benzene with cancer, and the UARG
3                                    case with greenhouse gas emissions.  All three
4                                    were the agency was applying this broad but
5                                    arguably cryptic language to a new context.  I
6                                    think that's one way to characterize them.
7                                    How do we think about that?
8                                    GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Well, I think,
9                                    Justice Kavanaugh, looking at those three cases
10                                   in particular, that the reason the Court
11                                   concluded that the language was -- was cryptic
12                                   or oblique was because it identified other
13                                   textual or structural reasons that ran counter
14                                   to the agency's interpretation.
15                                   So in the utility air case that you
16                                   referenced, the Court observed that the
17                                   asserted regulation would overthrow the entire
18                                   statutory scheme.  The agency conceded that it
19                                   was never what Congress could have possibly
20                                   intended.  So that was a structural indication
21                                   that the agency's regulation was impermissible.
22                                   With respect to the benzene case,
23                                   there, too, there was a question about whether
24                                   there was an entitlement to regulate without
25                                   any finding of risk, and that was in tension

1                                    with other statutory provisions, so there was a
2                                    conflict.
3                                    And with the Brown & Williamson case
4                                    that you mentioned, the Court chronicled a long
5                                    line of statutes that had directly addressed
6                                    the issue of regulation of tobacco products and
7                                    would have been flatly inconsistent with the
8                                    agency's asserted jurisdiction.
9                                    So there's never been a case where the
10                                   Court has just confronted broad language and
11                                   said, oh, it seems cryptic or oblique and so
12                                   it's a major question, and we're not going to
13                                   give it its plain meaning.  In all of those
14                                   cases there was a -- a -- a textual and
15                                   structural reason for the Court to conclude
16                                   that there was something wrong with the
17                                   agency's claimed authority.
18                                   JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  In all three cases
19                                   there were strong dissents that said the
20                                   opposite of that, though, that said actually
21                                   this statutory language is clear and that the
22                                   Court, you know, Justice Marshall's dissent in
23                                   the benzene case was very powerful that the
24                                   Court was simply scaling back from the plain
25                                   language because of its concern about the

1                                    significance of regulating every workplace in

3                                    So there were dissents that made that
4                                    point but the majority seemed nonetheless, to
5                                    apply the major questions doctrine.
6                                    GENERAL PRELOGAR:  There were
7                                    certainly dissents in those cases that thought
8                                    that the statutory terms could get the agency
9                                    there.  But here I think the critical
10                                   difference is that the applicants haven't
11                                   pointed to anything in this statute that
12                                   approximates the kind of textual or structural
13                                   problem that has prompted the Court to look at
14                                   those kinds of consequences before.
15                                   And it would be their interpretation
16                                   that creates those problems.  They would render
17                                   superfluous Section 669(a)(5)'s specific
18                                   recognition that immunization requirements can
19                                   be imposed under the OSH Act itself.  By saying
20                                   that OSHA can't regulate COVID-19 in the
21                                   workplace, they would give no effect to
22                                   Congress's appropriation just last year
23                                   directing OSHA to do just that, and to target
24                                   that grave danger.
25                                   And so in this case we think that all

1                                    of the textual clues line up on our side, in
2                                    addition to the plain language of the statute.
3                                    JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  And one other
4                                    question related to this -- sorry to prolong
5                                    this -- but Congress has specifically referred
6                                    to vaccines in a variety of contexts.
7                                    Immigration contexts, those statutes authorize
8                                    specifically via language vaccines.  Military
9                                    contexts, which you would expect, at least the
10                                   Anthrax vaccine is referenced in the military.
11                                   The National Childhood Vaccine Act passed in
12                                   '86 refers, and it's a different context, but
13                                   dealing with vaccines.  And so that's one
14                                   point.
15                                   And the other is since -- not forever,
16                                   but 2005, President Bush gave a very detailed
17                                   speech kind of predicting what has happened.
18                                   And it's eerie to read it, and yet in the -- in
19                                   the years since, there has not been at least a
20                                   vaccine statute passed by Congress to deal with
21                                   this kind of thing, even though he, in -- in
22                                   the wake of 9/11, but still was putting the
23                                   country on notice of this problem that was
24                                   going to hit us at some point.
25                                   GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Well, I certainly

1                                    recognize that there are other statutes where
2                                    Congress has specifically referred to
3                                    vaccination, and I think that maybe that would
4                                    get the Applicants some traction here if, for
5                                    example, this Act specifically referred to
6                                    other mitigation measures and -- and
7                                    illuminated what kinds of things OSHA can do
8                                    and left vaccination off the list.  But it
9                                    doesn't do that.
10                                   So I think to suggest that there is
11                                   some negative inference to be drawn is
12                                   inconsistent with how Congress drafted this
13                                   statute in recognition that OSHA would be
14                                   positioned to understand the kinds of control
15                                   measures that are necessary against the variety
16                                   of workplace hazards.
17                                   And if I could make just make one
18                                   additional point on that.  Of course, as I've
19                                   emphasized, there is an express reference to
20                                   immunization requirements in the OSH Act
21                                   itself, and we think that that actually
22                                   provides additional confirmation that Congress
23                                   was thinking about that and could have
24                                   anticipated it and that religious exemption
25                                   would have no application if, in fact,

1                                    immunization is just off limits.
2                                    But I think as well it's important to
3                                    look at this against the backdrop of
4                                    immunization requirements in our country.  This
5                                    is not some kind of newfangled thing.  As I've
6                                    mentioned before, most of us have been subject
7                                    to compulsory vaccination requirements at
8                                    various points throughout our lifetime.  And so
9                                    the idea that Congress couldn't have
10                                   anticipated that in dealing with the -- the
11                                   deadliest virus that OSHA has experienced in
12                                   its history, it might think that vaccination --
13                                   encouragement of vaccination would be an
14                                   appropriate way to protect workers, I think is
15                                   just inconsistent with the idea that
16                                   vaccination is often the single most effective
17                                   way to target a virus.
18                                   JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Thank you.
19                                   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice
20                                   Barrett.
21                                   JUSTICE BARRETT:  General Prelogar, I
22                                   have two questions, both of which address the
23                                   status of this rule as an emergency temporary
24                                   standard.  So my first question has to do with
25                                   the question with which Justice Thomas opened,

1                                    which is the meaning of "necessary."  So, of
2                                    course, when OSHA passes a rule through its
3                                    regular regulatory process, it has to go
4                                    through notice and comment, and that's a way of
5                                    holding an agency accountable.  All affected
6                                    people have an opportunity to comment, and the
7                                    agency develops a robust record.
8                                    With an ETS, of course, the agency can
9                                    circumvent that process so that it can act more
10                                   quickly.  So, for an ETS, we would want that
11                                   power to be the exception, not the rule.  And
12                                   one contrast that the Applicants point out
13                                   between OSHA's authority to issue an ETS versus
14                                   a regular regulation is that for its exercise
15                                   of power in the normal course, it need only
16                                   find that a regulation to be reasonably
17                                   necessary, but for an ETS, it has to satisfy a
18                                   necessary standard.
19                                   Now, you've argued, and I think
20                                   there's a lot of intuitive appeal to this, that
21                                   when you're facing an emergency of the
22                                   magnitude of this pandemic, that this power
23                                   effectively -- can be used most effectively as
24                                   a blunt instrument.  You know, we don't have
25                                   time to make industry-by-industry specific kind

1                                    of calculations because we want to move with
2                                    speed.
3                                    But how do you reconcile that
4                                    understanding of "necessary" with the broader
5                                    "reasonably necessary" standard in OSHA's
6                                    normal regulatory authority?
7                                    GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So we certainly
8                                    agree that the Emergency Temporary Standards'
9                                    reference to "necessary" as contrasted with
10                                   "reasonably necessary and appropriate" is a --
11                                   is a heightened burden and includes a measure
12                                   of tailoring that's necessary with respect to
13                                   the particular mitigation measures.
14                                   But I don't think that that helps the
15                                   Applicants here because they haven't come
16                                   forward with any alternative mitigation
17                                   measures that they think would equally protect
18                                   the workers that OSHA found were in grave --
19                                   JUSTICE BARRETT:  But do they have --
20                                   GENERAL PRELOGAR:                                 -- danger.
21                                   JUSTICE BARRETT:                                  -- to come forward
22                                   with that evidence or did OSHA have to consider
23                                   it and reject it?  Because another part of
24                                   their contention is that OSHA did not
25                                   adequately explain why this measure, this

1                                    particular rule and its scope was necessary
2                                    vis-α-vis or as compared to other
3                                    possibilities.
4                                    GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Well, OSHA
5                                    explained that at length over dozens of pages
6                                    in the 150-page preamble to the rule.  OSHA
7                                    specifically explained why vaccination as the
8                                    single most effective way to target all of the
9                                    ways that the virus threatens workers in the
10                                   workplace was a necessary measure here.
11                                   And it further explained why masking
12                                   and testing would be essential if workers
13                                   remain unvaccinated, in order to ensure that,
14                                   despite their higher risk level of contracting
15                                   the virus, they couldn't carry it into the
16                                   workplace and spread it to their coworkers.
17                                   So I think the suggestion that this
18                                   wasn't adequately explained is inconsistent
19                                   with the -- the arguments they're making.
20                                   And as I understand their tailoring
21                                   arguments -- and this actually touches on the
22                                   question you asked earlier in the argument --
23                                   they're really focused on two things, the
24                                   categories of workers and the -- the particular
25                                   workplaces.  And they haven't suggested that

1                                    there are other mitigation measures there that
2                                    OSHA neglected to consider.  They're saying
3                                    those things should have just been carved out
4                                    altogether.
5                                    But that is inconsistent with the
6                                    Secretary's judgment that all unvaccinated
7                                    workers face a grave danger and that the risk
8                                    exists anywhere that employees are gathered
9                                    indoors together.
10                                   And, again, there might be
11                                   subcategories within those groups that are in
12                                   graver danger, but I don't think there is any
13                                   basis on this record to conclude that the
14                                   agency lacked substantial evidence to draw the
15                                   lines that it did.
16                                   JUSTICE BARRETT:  That's helpful.
17                                   Thank you.
18                                   My -- my second question is, again,
19                                   about the status of this rule as an ETS.  So
20                                   Chief Judge Sutton pointed out in his dissent
21                                   from the denial of initial en banc that OSHA
22                                   did not adopt this rule in response to the
23                                   emergency qua emergency because that had been
24                                   ongoing since early 2020, but, instead, it
25                                   responded to new facts on the ground which

1                                    included the widespread availability of a
2                                    vaccine, that maybe it was a surprise many
3                                    people chose to forgo, and the emergence of the
4                                    Delta variant.
5                                    And Chief Judge Sutton pointed out
6                                    that in an extended pandemic, or I don't know
7                                    if we've moved to an endemic, such as this one,
8                                    facts will continually change.  New variants
9                                    will emerge.  There might be new treatments,
10                                   new vaccinations.  We have boosters now, right?
11                                   So now full vaccination might not just be the
12                                   two jabs; it might include a booster as well.
13                                   So when does the emergency end?  I
14                                   mean, a lot of this argument has been about
15                                   Congress's failure to act.  Two years from now,
16                                   do we have any reason to think that COVID will
17                                   be gone or that new variants might not be
18                                   emerging?  And when -- when must OSHA actually
19                                   resort to its regular authority and go through
20                                   notice and comment and not simply be kind of
21                                   doing it in this quick way, which doesn't
22                                   afford people the voice in the process that
23                                   they are otherwise entitled to?
24                                   GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So I think, if I
25                                   could respond to that in a few different ways,
Heritage Reporting Corporation

135
1                                    Congress defined when the emergency exists.  It
2                                    labeled this an Emergency Temporary Standard,
3                                    but it's dictated by the statutory
4                                    requirements.  So there has to be a grave
5                                    danger from a physically harmful agent or a new
6                                    hazard, and the measures have to be necessary
7                                    to protect against that danger.  And we don't
8                                    think that there is an additional free-floating
9                                    requirement about emergency status that has to
10                                   be taken into account.
11                                   JUSTICE BARRETT:  So it could be an
12                                   emergency two more years from now?
13                                   GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Well, I certainly
14                                   take the point that the emergency can be of
15                                   substantial duration.  Of course, this is not a
16                                   way to -- to bypass notice and comment
17                                   permanently.  Congress further specified that
18                                   the agency is expected to conduct a rulemaking
19                                   process over six months, and that's why the
20                                   agency estimated the lives saved, the
21                                   hospitalizations prevented over the six-month
22                                   life of the rule.
23                                   JUSTICE BARRETT:  Sure, but I was
24                                   envisioning a new rule, right?  Like, you know,
25                                   OSHA might, two years from now, adopt something

1                                    that's different from this vaccine or
2                                    mask-and-test mandate.  I'm just talking about
3                                    the limits more generally on OSHA's power under
4                                    the ETS provision.
5                                    GENERAL PRELOGAR:  The limits, I
6                                    think, are the ones written into the statute.
7                                    And so, if you want to project out two years
8                                    from now, I think it's entirely possible, of
9                                    course, that the trajectory of the pandemic
10                                   will change.  I certainly hope so.  And in that
11                                   case, OSHA, I think, would have to, if it
12                                   wanted to regulate again, cross the high burden
13                                   of showing a grave danger.
14                                   You know, this is a -- an authority it
15                                   has used sparingly in cases of -- of what we
16                                   think are true emergencies, and I think to
17                                   suggest based on concern about what might
18                                   happen in the future that its authority should
19                                   be constrained or clipped now, when we are in
20                                   the middle of an unprecedented pandemic that is
21                                   claiming more lives than we've seen in a
22                                   shorter amount of time, would do a disservice
23                                   to Congress's anticipation that OSHA might need
24                                   to act quickly in response to dangers like
25                                   this.

2                                    CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Keller,
3                                    rebuttal?
4                                    REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT A. KELLER
5                                    ON BEHALF OF THE APPLICANTS IN NO. 21A244
6                                    MR. KELLER:  Two points, Mr. Chief
7                                    Justice.
8                                    First, we need a stay now before
9                                    enforcement starts.  Our members have to submit
10                                   publicly their plans to how to comply with this
11                                   regulatory behemoth on Monday.  Vaccines would
12                                   need to occur by February 9.  You would need
13                                   two vaccines to comply.  Those vaccines would
14                                   have to start immediately.  Tracking and
15                                   recordkeeping cannot happen overnight.
16                                   And on tests, you heard my friend, the
17                                   Solicitor General, mention the media reports
18                                   that we've all seen about shortages of tests
19                                   and costs increasing.  Our declarations,
20                                   Appendix page 345 and 374, confirm that as
21                                   well.
22                                   And that's exactly why workers will
23                                   quit right away.  You don't even have to take
24                                   our word for it.  The federal government, the
25                                   Postal Service and Amtrak, both say the same

1                                    things.  What OSHA did is they cherry-picked
2                                    one study about healthcare workers, a very
3                                    specific industry, and what that worker
4                                    attrition rate would be.  Again, two
5                                    declaration cites, we have plenty more, but
6                                    Appendix pages 351 and 374.
7                                    And my second point to close on is
8                                    about who decides in the public interest.  And
9                                    I would submit that this Court's precedents
10                                   answer that.
11                                   We're not asking this Court to reverse
12                                   anything.  Industrial union 40 years ago in
13                                   Justice Stevens's controlling opinion says that
14                                   there was an absence of a clear mandate in the
15                                   OSH Act, so it's unreasonable to assume that
16                                   Congress gave OSHA unprecedented power over
17                                   American industry and the emergency power is
18                                   also narrowly circumscribed, yet here OSHA has
19                                   never before done mandated vaccines or
20                                   widespread testing much less over all
21                                   industries or on an emergency basis.
22                                   So whether we're talking about the
23                                   agency's failure to explain, whether we're
24                                   talking about the statutory terms necessary,
25                                   whether we're talking about how this has to be

9                                    spread of the COVID-19 delta variant but our

12                                   We would respectfully request a stay
