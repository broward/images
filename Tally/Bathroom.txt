My name is Broward L. Horne.  On July 4th weekend, 2014, I was stopped at a sobriety checkpoint
in Denver and eventually received a misdemeanor DUI charge.  This charge is still on my record
after 10 years and blocking my license renewal.

I'm requesting an official physical letter via USPS with a signed name and title of someone
who is legally accountable which states that my misdemeanor does not fall under the CO
statute of limitations, as I was informed by email last year.

I'm also requesting a FULL set of methods to resolve this.  I've been told by a Pierce County
sheriff's clerk that I should be able to fill an exoneration form.

In an age when Colorado hands out driver's licenses like candy to illegal aliens with real
criminal records, it's interesting that it can hypocritically maintain passive harassment
against a disabled veteran with a virtually crime-free record for 66 years.  This letter has
been sent by email and USPS certified mail.
